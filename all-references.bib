To stay as close as possible to the emissions as officially reported and used in policy assessment, the inventory uses the officially reported emission data by European countries to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the EU National Emission Ceilings Directive as the basis where possible. Where deemed necessary because of errors, incompleteness or inconsistencies, these are replaced with or complemented by other emission data, most notably the estimates included in the Greenhouse gas Air pollution Interaction and Synergies (GAINS) model. Emissions are collected at the high sectoral level, distinguishing around 250 different sector–fuel combinations, whereafter a consistent spatial distribution is applied for Europe. A specific proxy is selected for each of the sector–fuel combinations, pollutants and years. Point source emissions are largely based on reported facility-level emissions, complemented by other sources of point source data for power plants. For specific sources, the resulting emission data were replaced with other datasets. Emissions from shipping (both inland and at sea) are based on the results from a separate shipping emission model where emissions are based on actual ship movement data, and agricultural waste burning emissions are based on satellite observations. The resulting spatially distributed emissions are evaluated against earlier versions of the dataset as well as against alternative emission estimates, which reveals specific discrepancies in some cases. Along with the resulting annual emission maps, profiles for splitting particulate matter (PM) and NMVOCs into individual components are provided, as well as information on the height profile by sector and temporal disaggregation down to the hourly level to support modelling activities. Annual grid maps are available in csv and NetCDF format ({\textless}a href="https://doi.org/10.24380/0vzb-a387"{\textgreater}https://doi.org/10.24380/0vzb-a387{\textless}/a{\textgreater}, Kuenen et al., 2021).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This review examines development of the technique as a tool for ABL research, integration with state-of-the-art scientific computing resources, and some key application areas. Analysis of the published literature indicates that LES research across a broad range of applications accelerated starting around 1990. From that point in time, robust research using LES developed in several different application areas and based on a review of the papers published in this journal, we identify seven major areas of intensive ABL–LES research: convective boundary layers, stable boundary layers, transitional boundary layers, plant canopy flows, urban meteorology and dispersion, surface heterogeneity, and the testing and development of subgrid-scale (SGS) models. We begin with a general overview of LES and then proceed to examine the SGS models developed for use in ABL–LES. After this overview of the technique itself, we review the specific model developments tailored to the identified application areas and the scientific advancements realized using the LES technique in each area. We conclude by examining the computational trends in published ABL–LES research and identify some resource underutilization. Future directions and research needs are identified from a synthesis of the reviewed literature.},

Shallow convective clouds first formed over southeast Oklahoma and then spread toward the northwest into southern Kansas. By the early afternoon, the relatively uniform shallow cloud field became more complex in which some regions became nearly cloud free and in other regions larger shallow clouds developed with some transitioning to deeper, precipitating convection. We show that the model reproduces the observed heterogeneity in the cloud populations only when realistic variations in soil moisture are used to initialize the model. While more variable soil moisture and to a lesser extent cool lake temperatures drive the initial spatial heterogeneity in the cloud populations, precipitation-driven cold pools become an important factor after 1300 CST. When smoother soil moisture variations are used in the model, more uniform shallow cloud populations are predicted with far fewer clouds that transition to deeper, precipitating convection that produce cold pools. An algorithm that tracks thousands of individual cumulus show that the more realistic soil moisture distributions produces clouds that are larger and have a longer lifetime. The results suggest that shallow and deep convection parameterizations used by mesoscale models need to account for the effects of variable land-atmosphere interactions and cold pools.},

To pursue this goal, increasingly sophisticated cloud-scale models are needed to complement the limited supply of observations of the interactions between aerosols and clouds. For this purpose, a new large-eddy simulation (LES) model, coupled with an interactive sectional description for aerosols and clouds, is introduced. The new model builds and extends upon the well-characterized UCLA Large-Eddy Simulation Code (UCLALES) and the Sectional Aerosol module for Large-Scale Applications (SALSA), hereafter denoted as UCLALES-SALSA. Novel strategies for the aerosol, cloud and precipitation bin discretisation are presented. These enable tracking the effects of cloud processing and wet scavenging on the aerosol size distribution as accurately as possible, while keeping the computational cost of the model as low as possible. The model is tested with two different simulation set-ups: a marine stratocumulus case in the DYCOMS-II campaign and another case focusing on the formation and evolution of a nocturnal radiation fog. It is shown that, in both cases, the size-resolved interactions between aerosols and clouds have a critical influence on the dynamics of the boundary layer. The results demonstrate the importance of accurately representing the wet scavenging of aerosol in the model. Specifically, in a case with marine stratocumulus, precipitation and the subsequent removal of cloud activating particles lead to thinning of the cloud deck and the formation of a decoupled boundary layer structure. In radiation fog, the growth and sedimentation of droplets strongly affect their radiative properties, which in turn drive new droplet formation. The size-resolved diagnostics provided by the model enable investigations of these issues with high detail. It is also shown that the results remain consistent with UCLALES (without SALSA) in cases where the dominating physical processes remain well represented by both models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This paper describes and evaluates a new Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC), with a special focus on addressing the long-standing issues in solving the dynamic partitioning of semivolatile inorganic gases (HNO3, HCl, and NH3) to size-distributed atmospheric aerosol particles. The coupled ordinary differential equations (ODE) for dynamic gas-particle mass transfer are extremely stiff, and the available numerical techniques are either very expensive or produce oscillatory solutions. These limitations are overcome in MOSAIC with a new dynamic gas-particle partitioning module, which is coupled to an efficient and accurate thermodynamics module. The algorithm includes a new concept of “dynamic pH,” a novel formulation for mass transfer to mixed-phase and solid particles, and an adaptive time stepping scheme, which together hold the key to smooth, accurate, and efficient solutions of gas-particle partitioning over the entire relative humidity range. MOSAIC is found to be in excellent agreement with a benchmark version of the model that uses a rigorous solver for integrating the stiff ODEs. The steady-state MOSAIC results for monodisperse aerosol test cases are also in excellent agreement with those obtained with the benchmark equilibrium model AIM. Moreover, the CPU times required for fully dynamic solutions by MOSAIC per size bin per 5 min intervals (typical 3-D model time steps) are similar to those for bulk equilibrium solutions by the computationally efficient but relatively less accurate model ISORROPIA. These results show that MOSAIC is extremely efficient without compromising accuracy, and is therefore highly attractive for use in air quality and regional/global aerosol models.},

To improve the mixing state representation in models, we present a new approach, the stochastic particle-resolved model PartMC-MOSAIC, which explicitly resolves the composition of individual particles in a given population of different types of aerosol particles. This approach tracks the evolution of the mixing state of particles due to emission, dilution, condensation, and coagulation. To make this direct stochastic particle-based method practical, we implemented a new multiscale stochastic coagulation method. With this method we achieved high computational efficiency for situations when the coagulation kernel is highly nonuniform, as is the case for many realistic applications. PartMC-MOSAIC was applied to an idealized urban plume case representative of a large urban area to simulate the evolution of carbonaceous aerosols of different types due to coagulation and condensation. For this urban plume scenario we quantified the individual processes that contributed to the aging of the aerosol distribution, illustrating the capabilities of our modeling approach. The results showed for the first time the multidimensional structure of particle composition, which is usually lost in sectional or modal aerosol models.},

	abstract = {Aerosol particles in the atmosphere are complex mixtures of different chemical species, and their compositions are constantly evolving as coagulation and multiphase processes act on the particle population. The particles interact with the climate system directly by scattering and absorbing solar radiation, and indirectly by forming clouds. These macroscale climate effects depend on the size and composition of individual particles. Simulating the evolution of aerosols and predicting their impacts remains a challenge due to the multiscale nature of the system. Various methods exist for representing aerosols in models, which range in complexity and computational cost — from very simple and computationally efficient, suitable for simulation on the regional and global scale, to highly-detailed and computational expensive, suitable for box model simulations on the process level.
With the development of the particle-resolved model PartMC-MOSAIC, it became possible to simulate the aerosol mixing state in great detail. However, previous applications of PartMC-MOSAIC have lacked spatial resolution, which only a three-dimensional chemical transport model can provide. To address this shortcoming, the goal of this thesis was to create a particle-resolved aerosol modeling framework that is also spatially resolved, the first of its kind. Several modeling advances were required to attain this goal. At the core was the development of efficient algorithms for particle transport in three dimensions and particle removal at the surface by dry deposition. Additionally, we have contributed a framework for developing particle-resolved, source-oriented aerosol emissions. This framework is flexible and can make use of a variety of user-defined emission data sets.
We applied the newly developed model system to simulate an episode during the Carbonaceous Aerosol and Radiative Effects Study (CARES) campaign in California in June 2010. The interactions of atmospheric transport and spatially distributed emissions led to a rapid aging of aerosols in urban areas resulting in internally mixed populations in those areas. Errors in cloud condensation nuclei concentrations when assuming internally mixed aerosols were quantified using a composition-averaging technique to replicate a sectional aerosol representation, which is common in many state-of-the-art chemical transport models. These errors amount up to 100\% for more externally mixed populations, and can remain up to 50\% for region that are internally mixed. This dissertation research created a new framework model for high-detail aerosol simulations on the regional scale and a benchmark capability for the community to quantify errors in predicted aerosol impacts due to simplified aerosol representations.},

	abstract = {A theoretical treatment of the problems of eddy diffusion and evaporation is developed, based on the use of well-established laboratory data for the laws of turbulent flow. Expressions which are free from adjustable constants and involve only directly measurable quantities are derived for the two-dimensional diffusion of matter and evaporation of liquid in flow over aerodynamically smooth and rough surfaces. For aerodynamically smooth surfaces the evaporation formulae obtained are identical with those found previously by O. G. Sutton using a different treatment. The latter results, which have been shown to be in good agreement with laboratory experiments, may be derived independently as a special case by a more direct method involving fewer assumptions. The formulae obtained for aerodynamically rough surfaces are in excellent agreement with observational data on the diffusion of smoke in the lower atmosphere under adiabatic conditions, and on the evaporation of liquid from the ground surface.The treatment may also be applied to the transfer of heat from aerodynamically smooth and rough surfaces provided the temperature differences are not too large.},

The authors deal with the theory of hydrodynamic instability and the development of turbulence, the application of dimensional analysis, and the theory of similarity to turbulent flow in pipes, ducts, and boundary layers, as well as free turbulence. They discuss semiempirical theories of turbulence, develop the similarity theory for turbulence in nonhomogeneous media, and present Lagrangian characteristics of turbulence and the theory of turbulent diffusion. Every effort has been made to present a wealth of experimental material; a large number of examples are drawn from physics of the atmosphere, permitting a generalization of results beyond that which can be obtained in the laboratory. Considerable attention has been given to Kolmogorov's theory of the local structure of developed turbulence and to the theory of turbulence in stratified media.},

Our sensitivity methodology relies on the non-intrusive approach of the generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) method; the gPC is a spectral non-statistical numerical method well-suited to representing random processes not restricted to Gaussian fields. The analysis is carried out at Reλ, =, 100 and for different grid resolutions and Cs distributions. Numerical predictions are also compared to direct numerical simulation evidence. We have shown that the different turbulent scales of the LES solution respond differently to the variability in Cs. In particular, the study of the relative turbulent kinetic energy distributions for different Cs distributions indicates that small scales are mainly affected by changes in the subgrid-model parametric uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric sulfate aerosols have important impacts on air quality, climate, and human and ecosystem health. However, current air-quality models generally underestimate the rate of conversion of sulfur dioxide (SO2) to sulfate during severe haze pollution events, indicating that our understanding of sulfate formation chemistry is incomplete. This may arise because the air-quality models rely upon kinetics studies of SO2 oxidation conducted in dilute aqueous solutions, and not at the high solute strengths of atmospheric aerosol particles. Here, we utilize an aerosol flow reactor to perform direct investigation on the kinetics of aqueous oxidation of dissolved SO2 by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using pH-buffered, submicrometer, deliquesced aerosol particles at relative humidity of 73 to 90\%. We find that the high solute strength of the aerosol particles significantly enhances the sulfate formation rate for the H2O2 oxidation pathway compared to the dilute solution. By taking these effects into account, our results indicate that the oxidation of SO2 by H2O2 in the liquid water present in atmospheric aerosol particles can contribute to the missing sulfate source during severe haze episodes.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulation (LES) models are an excellent tool to improve our understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI). We introduce a prognostic aerosol scheme with multiple aerosol species in the Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation model (DALES), especially focused on simulating the impact of cloud microphysical processes on the aerosol population. The numerical treatment of aerosol activation is a crucial element for simulating both cloud and aerosol characteristics. Two methods are implemented and discussed: an explicit activation scheme based on κ-Köhler theory and a more classic approach using updraught strength. Sample model simulations are based on the Rain in Shallow Cumulus over the Ocean (RICO) campaign, characterized by rapidly precipitating warm-phase shallow cumulus clouds.

 We find that in this pristine ocean environment virtually all aerosol mass in cloud droplets is the result of the activation process, while in-cloud scavenging is relatively inefficient. Despite the rapid formation of precipitation, most of the in-cloud aerosol mass is returned to the atmosphere by cloud evaporation. The strength of aerosol processing through subsequent cloud cycles is found to be particularly sensitive to the activation scheme and resulting cloud characteristics. However, the precipitation processes are considerably less sensitive. Scavenging by precipitation is the dominant source for in-rain aerosol mass. About half of the in-rain aerosol reaches the surface, while the rest is released by evaporation of falling precipitation. The effect of cloud microphysics on the average aerosol size depends on the balance between the evaporation of clouds and rain and ultimate removal by precipitation. Analysis of typical aerosol size associated with the different microphysical processes shows that aerosols resuspended by cloud evaporation have a radius that is only 5\&thinsp;\% to 10\&thinsp;\% larger than the originally activated aerosols. In contrast, aerosols released by evaporating precipitation are an order of magnitude larger.},

	abstract = {A cloud-resolving model (CRM) coupled to a new intermediate-complexity bulk aerosol scheme is used to study aerosol–boundary-layer–cloud–precipitation interactions and the development of pockets of open cells (POCs) in subtropical stratocumulus cloud layers. The aerosol scheme prognoses mass and number concentration of a single lognormal accumulation mode with surface and entrainment sources, evolving subject to processing of activated aerosol and scavenging of dry aerosol by clouds and rain. 

 The CRM with the aerosol scheme is applied to a range of steadily forced cases idealized from a well-observed POC. The long-term system evolution is explored with extended two-dimensional (2-D) simulations of up to 20 days, mostly with diurnally averaged insolation and 24 km wide domains, and one 10 day three-dimensional (3-D) simulation. Both 2-D and 3-D simulations support the Baker–Charlson hypothesis of two distinct aerosol–cloud "regimes" (deep/high-aerosol/non-drizzling and shallow/low-aerosol/drizzling) that persist for days; transitions between these regimes, driven by either precipitation scavenging or aerosol entrainment from the free-troposphere (FT), occur on a timescale of ten hours. The system is analyzed using a two-dimensional phase plane with inversion height and boundary layer average aerosol concentrations as state variables; depending on the specified subsidence rate and availability of FT aerosol, these regimes are either stable equilibria or distinct legs of a slow limit cycle. 

 The same steadily forced modeling framework is applied to the coupled development and evolution of a POC and the surrounding overcast boundary layer in a larger 192 km wide domain. An initial 50\% aerosol reduction is applied to half of the model domain. This has little effect until the stratocumulus thickens enough to drizzle, at which time the low-aerosol portion transitions into open-cell convection, forming a POC. Reduced entrainment in the POC induces a negative feedback between the areal fraction covered by the POC and boundary layer depth changes. This stabilizes the system by controlling liquid water path and precipitation sinks of aerosol number in the overcast region, while also preventing boundary layer collapse within the POC, allowing the POC and overcast to coexist indefinitely in a quasi-steady equilibrium.},

Comparison of the LES results from two chemical schemes (simple NOx-O3 chemistry and a more comprehensive Reduced Chemical Scheme (RCS) chemical mechanism) shows that the concentrations of NO2 and Ox inside the street canyon are enhanced by approximately 30–40\% via OH/HO2 chemistry. NO, NOx, O3, OH and HO2 are chemically consumed, while NO2 and Ox (total oxidant) are chemically produced within the canyon environment. Within-canyon pre-processing increases oxidant fluxes from the canyon to the overlying boundary layer, and this effect is greater for deeper street canyons (as found in many traditional European urban centres) than shallower (lower aspect ratio) streets. There is clear evidence of distinct behaviours for emitted chemical species and entrained chemical species, and positive (or negative) values of intensities of segregations are found between pairs of species with similar (or opposite) behaviour. The simplified two-box model underestimated NO and O3 levels, but overestimated NO2 levels for both the lower and upper canyon compared with the more realistic LES-chemistry model. This suggests that the segregation effect due to incomplete mixing reduces the chemical conversion rate of NO to NO2. This study reveals the impacts of nonlinear O3-NOx-VOC photochemical processes in the incomplete mixing environment and provides a better understanding of the pre-processing of emissions within canyons, prior to their release to the urban boundary layer, through the coupling of street canyon dynamics and chemistry.},

The spatial variation of pollutants is significant due to the existence of two unsteady vortices. The deviation of species abundance from chemical equilibrium for the upper vortex is greater than that for the lower vortex. The interplay of dynamics and chemistry is investigated using two metrics: the photostationary state defect, and the inferred ozone production rate. The latter is found to be negative at all locations within the canyon, pointing to a systematic negative offset to ozone production rates inferred by analogous approaches in environments with incomplete mixing of emissions. This study demonstrates an approach to quantify parameters for a simplified two-box model, which could support traffic management and urban planning strategies and personal exposure assessment.},

	abstract = {Exchanges of reactive gases between forests and the atmosphere influence tropospheric chemistry, climate, and ecosystems. Chemistry inside canopies can alter these exchanges yet understanding of the chemistry and processes influencing the chemistry is incomplete. Previous work prioritizes complex chemical mechanisms over micrometeorology in the multilayer models of forests used to understand in-canopy chemistry and its impacts. Instead, here we use a new simplified chemical mechanism and resolve turbulence in a multilayer canopy model. Specifically, we describe a new version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research large eddy simulation (LES) coupled to both a multilayer canopy model and a chemical mechanism. The mechanism has 41 reactions and 19 gases for ozone, NOx (=NO + NO2), HOx (=OH + HO2), and isoprene chemistry. We evaluate the mechanism against two more complex mechanisms using box modeling. We configure the LES for a temperate deciduous forest and summer midday weak-wind buoyancy-forced conditions. The multilayer canopy model necessitates estimates of reactant sources and sinks at each canopy level, and thus we describe multilayer parameterizations for dry deposition and biogenic emissions. For the first time with an LES coupled to both a multilayer canopy and chemistry, we demonstrate variability in chemical reactions due to turbulence-induced segregation of reactants inside and just above the canopy. For the cases examined here, in-canopy segregation alters reaction rates that only consider well-mixed conditions by up to −48\% to +23\%. For many reactions, segregation is stronger when soil NO emissions reflect the upper bound of observed values for temperate forests.},

The model includes a simple binary, irreversible reaction without heat release. Subgrid-scale contributions of reactions are neglected as justified by spectral analysis of the results. The results depend upon the ratio R of time scales for convection relative to that of the chemical reaction, on the concentration ratio of the two reacting components, and on the initial conditions. Cases with zero, finite and infinite reaction rate are considered. Without reactions, the bottom-up diffusivity is about twice as large as top-down diffusivity due to buoyancy effects. For infinite reaction rate, the thin reaction layer becomes highly convoluted. For R {\textgreater} 0.1, i.e. for parameter values which are typical for the reaction between ozone and nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere, the reaction rate is strongly influenced by turbulence. The effective eddy diffusivities may be enhanced or reduced by chemical reactions, depending on the importance of gradient forcings of mass fluxes relative to other source and sink terms. A simple ‘box-model’ describes the time evolution of the mean concentrations in the mixed layer fairly well for R ⩽0.1 and for infinite reaction rate.},

The tracer source is at the surface in one case, and in the inversion layer in the other case. Results show that shallow cumulus clouds can significantly enhance vertical transport of the tracer in both cases. In the case with surface-borne pollutants, cloudy regions are responsible for the upward transport, due to the intense updrafts in cumulus clouds. In the case where pollutants are aloft, cloud-free regions are responsible for the downward transport, but the downward transport mainly occurs in thin regions around cloud edges. This is consistent with previous aircraft measurements of downdrafts around cumulus clouds and indicates that the downward transport is also cloud-induced. Cumulus convection is therefore able to both vent pollutants upward from the surface and fumigate pollutants in the inversion layer downward into the lower boundary layer.},

	abstract = {Clouds and aerosols contribute the largest uncertainty to current estimates and interpretations of the Earth’s changing energy budget. Here we use a new-generation large-domain large-eddy model, ICON-LEM (ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic Large Eddy Model), to simulate the response of clouds to realistic anthropogenic perturbations in aerosols serving as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The novelty compared to previous studies is that (i) the LEM is run in weather prediction mode and with fully interactive land surface over a large domain and (ii) a large range of data from various sources are used for the detection and attribution. The aerosol perturbation was chosen as peak-aerosol conditions over Europe in 1985, with more than fivefold more sulfate than in 2013. Observational data from various satellite and ground-based remote sensing instruments are used, aiming at the detection and attribution of this response. The simulation was run for a selected day (2 May 2013) in which a large variety of cloud regimes was present over the selected domain of central Europe.

 It is first demonstrated that the aerosol fields used in the model are consistent with corresponding satellite aerosol optical depth retrievals for both 1985 (perturbed) and 2013 (reference) conditions. In comparison to retrievals from ground-based lidar for 2013, CCN profiles for the reference conditions were consistent with the observations, while the ones for the 1985 conditions were not.

 Similarly, the detection and attribution process was successful for droplet number concentrations: the ones simulated for the 2013 conditions were consistent with satellite as well as new ground-based lidar retrievals, while the ones for the 1985 conditions were outside the observational range.

 For other cloud quantities, including cloud fraction, liquid water path, cloud base altitude and cloud lifetime, the aerosol response was small compared to their natural variability. Also, large uncertainties in satellite and ground-based observations make the detection and attribution difficult for these quantities. An exception to this is the fact that at a large liquid water path value (LWP \&gt; 200\&thinsp;g\&thinsp;m−2), the control simulation matches the observations, while the perturbed one shows an LWP which is too large.

 The model simulations allowed for quantifying the radiative forcing due to aerosol–cloud interactions, as well as the adjustments to this forcing. The latter were small compared to the variability and showed overall a small positive radiative effect. The overall effective radiative forcing (ERF) due to aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFaci) in the simulation was dominated thus by the Twomey effect and yielded for this day, region and aerosol perturbation −2.6\&thinsp;W\&thinsp;m−2. Using general circulation models to scale this to a global-mean present-day vs. pre-industrial ERFaci yields a global ERFaci of −0.8\&thinsp;W\&thinsp;m−2.},

	abstract = {In this article we describe the implementation of an online-coupled gas-phase chemistry model in the turbulence-resolving PALM model system 6.0 (formerly an abbreviation for Parallelized Large-eddy Simulation Model and now an independent name). The new chemistry model is implemented in the PALM model as part of the PALM-4U (PALM for urban applications) components, which are designed for application of the PALM model in the urban environment (Maronga et al., 2020). The latest version of the Kinetic PreProcessor (KPP, 2.2.3) has been utilized for the numerical integration of gas-phase chemical reactions. A number of tropospheric gas-phase chemistry mechanisms of different complexity have been implemented ranging from the photostationary state (PHSTAT) to mechanisms with a strongly simplified volatile organic compound (VOC) chemistry (e.g. the SMOG mechanism from KPP) and the Carbon Bond Mechanism 4 (CBM4; Gery et al., 1989), which includes a more comprehensive, but still simplified VOC chemistry. Further mechanisms can also be easily added by the user. In this work, we provide a detailed description of the chemistry model, its structure and input requirements along with its various features and limitations. A case study is presented to demonstrate the application of the new chemistry model in the urban environment. The computation domain of the case study comprises part of Berlin, Germany. Emissions are considered using street-type-dependent emission factors from traffic sources. Three chemical mechanisms of varying complexity and one no-reaction (passive) case have been applied, and results are compared with observations from two permanent air quality stations in Berlin that fall within the computation domain. Even though the feedback of the model's aerosol concentrations on meteorology is not yet considered in the current version of the model, the results show the importance of online photochemistry and dispersion of air pollutants in the urban boundary layer for high spatial and temporal resolutions. The simulated NOx and O3 species show reasonable agreement with observations. The agreement is better during midday and poorest during the evening transition hours and at night. The CBM4 and SMOG mechanisms show better agreement with observations than the steady-state PHSTAT mechanism.},

The capabilities of such models are discussed based on comparisons with observations and model-intercomparison studies. CRMs are used in a variety of ways, from the exploration of cloud phenomenology and process-understanding studies to the development of algorithms for satellite products, as well as to address climate issues and to develop convective and cloud parametrizations for large-scale weather and climate models. A few results illustrating this wide utilization are presented. The continuous increase of computer power induces rapid changes in modelling perspectives and therefore, influences the developments and applications of CRMs. This is discussed together with emerging scientific questions which will further benefit from CRM simulations.},

	abstract = {Complex distributions of aerosol properties evolve in space and time as a function of emissions, new particle formation, coagulation, condensational growth, chemical transformation, phase changes, turbulent mixing and transport, removal processes, and ambient meteorological conditions. The ability of chemical transport models to represent the multi-scale processes affecting the life cycle of aerosols depends on their spatial resolution since aerosol properties are assumed to be constant within a grid cell. Subgrid-scale-dependent processes that affect aerosol populations could have a significant impact on the formation of particles, their growth to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) sizes, aerosol–cloud interactions, dry deposition and rainout and hence their burdens, lifetimes, and radiative forcing. To address this issue, we characterize subgrid-scale variability in terms of measured aerosol number, size, composition, hygroscopicity, and CCN concentrations made by repeated aircraft flight paths over the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program's Southern Great Plains (SGP) site during the Holistic Interactions of Shallow Clouds, Aerosols and Land Ecosystem (HI-SCALE) campaign. Subgrid variability is quantified in terms of both normalized frequency distributions and percentage difference percentiles using grid spacings of 3, 9, 27, and 81 km that represent those typically used by cloud-system-resolving models as well as the current and next-generation climate models. Even though the SGP site is a rural location, surprisingly large horizontal gradients in aerosol properties were frequently observed. For example, 90 \% of the 3, 9, and 27 km cell mean organic matter concentrations differed from the 81 km cell around the SGP site by as much as ∼ 46 \%, large spatial variability in aerosol number concentrations and size distributions were found during new particle formation events, and consequently 90 \% of the 3, 9, and 27 km cell mean CCN number concentrations differed from the 81 km cell mean by as much as ∼ 38 \%. The spatial variability varied seasonally for some aerosol properties, with some having larger spatial variability during the spring and others having larger variability during the late summer. While measurements at a single surface site cannot reflect the surrounding variability of aerosol properties at a given time, aircraft measurements that are averaged within an 81 km cell were found to be similar to many, but not all, aerosol properties measured at the ground SGP site. This analysis suggests that it is reasonable to directly compare most ground SGP site aerosol measurements with coarse global climate model predictions. In addition, the variability quantified by the aircraft can be used as an uncertainty range when comparing the surface point measurements with model predictions that use coarse grid spacings.},

	abstract = {Abstract Idealized large-eddy simulations (LESs) with prescribed heterogeneous land surface heat fluxes are performed to study the impact of the heterogeneity length scale and background wind speed on the development of shallow cumulus and the subsequent transition to congestus/deep convection. We study the impact of land surface heterogeneity in an atmosphere that favors shallow convection but is also conditionally unstable with respect to deeper convection. We find that before the convection transition, larger and thicker shallow cumulus clouds are attached to moisture pools near the PBL top over patches with low evaporative fraction (referred to as “DRY”). This feature is attributable to a surface-induced secondary circulation whose development depends on the heterogeneity size and the background wind speed. With large patches (≥5 km) under zero ambient wind, the secondary mesoscale circulation promotes the vertical transport of moisture forming a moisture pool over DRY patches, while with smaller patches, no such circulation develops. The influence of the background wind on the secondary circulation is strong such that any wind stronger than 2 m s−1 effectively eliminates the impact of surface heterogeneity on the PBL and brings no secondary circulation. This is because the triggered secondary circulation is not strong enough to withstand the imposed background wind. Based on these, we propose two criteria for the convection transition, namely, that the heterogeneity length scale is greater than 5 km and that the background wind speed is less than Uc0, where Uc0 is the near-surface cross-patch wind speed of the secondary circulation under zero background wind for a given patch size and is about 1.5 m s−1 in our cases.},

During late summer, ShCu occurs over cities the most frequently and over open waters the least frequently, and more often over forest than over grassland. The preferential occurrence of ShCu over forest relative to grassland is consistent with surface measurements showing larger heat fluxes over forests. This preferential occurrence also varies with the length scales of land patches with the largest cloud occurrence difference shifting from smaller length scales ({\textless}9 km) during midday to larger scales ({\textgreater}9 km) in the early afternoon. Consistent with theory, these signals are more pronounced under low wind conditions. The preferential length scale shift with time suggests the existence of secondary circulations that strengthen and promote convergence over larger spatial scales as the differential land surface heating intensifies.},

	abstract = {Advances in numerical modeling of cloud dynamics are driving a need for improved land model prediction at convective storm scales. In this study, satellite and ground-based vegetation remote sensing data were combined with land model experiments to more accurately characterize land surface spatial heterogeneity in the Community Land Model (CLM4.0). The new subgrid classification of plant functional types (PFT) and leaf area index (LAI) enables consistent comparison between models and ground-based flux measurements in the U.S. southern Great Plains. Errors in vegetation data sets (inferred from comparison between 250 m satellite and ground-based LAI), while large, had less impact on the simulated characteristics of spatial heterogeneity compared to errors in model representation of surface energy partitioning (between latent and sensible heat flux) and its relationship to LAI. Predicted spatial heterogeneity in surface energy partitioning was enhanced after replacing soil and stomatal resistance parameters with a new set that better predicts the observed relationship to LAI. These modifications increase the number of smaller (mesoscale) dry land patches having higher sensible heat flux. The parameter experiments suggest that vegetation state and processes (transpiration) act to broaden the size spectrum of surface heat flux heterogeneity, which can influence clouds and convective initiation. Moreover, improvements in vegetation input data and model parameters had partially compensating effects on surface flux heterogeneity, indicating the importance of evaluating input data and parameterizations together to improve prediction at higher spatial resolutions.},

	abstract = {Mixing is relevant to many areas of science and engineering, including the pharmaceutical and food industries, oceanography, atmospheric sciences and civil engineering. In all these situations one goal is to quantify and often then to improve the degree of homogenization of a substance being stirred, referred to as a passive scalar or tracer. A classical measure of mixing is the variance of the concentration of the scalar, which is the L2 norm of a mean-zero concentration field. Recently, other norms have been used to quantify mixing, in particular the mix-norm as well as negative Sobolev norms. These norms have the advantage that unlike variance they decay even in the absence of diffusion, and their decay corresponds to the flow being mixing in the sense of ergodic theory. General Sobolev norms weigh scalar gradients differently, and are known as multiscale norms for mixing. We review the applications of such norms to mixing and transport, and show how they can be used to optimize the stirring and mixing of a decaying passive scalar. We then review recent work on the less-studied case of a continuously replenished scalar field—the source–sink problem. In that case the flows that optimally reduce the norms are associated with transport rather than mixing: they push sources onto sinks, and vice versa.},

As an illustration, a numerical experiment is conducted in the megacity of Hong Kong, which is characterized by multi-type inhomogeneous pollution sources and complex topography. The results from the multi-resolution simulations at mesoscale and LES scales are evaluated by comparing them with ozone sounding profiles and surface observations. The comparisons show that both mesoscale and LES simulations reproduce the mean concentrations of the chemical species and their diurnal variations at the background stations well. However, the mesoscale simulations largely underestimate the NOx concentrations and overestimate O3 at the roadside stations due to the coarse representation of the traffic emissions. The LES simulations improve the agreement with the measurements near the road traffic, and the LES with the highest spatial resolution (33.3 m) provides the best results. The large-eddy simulations show more detailed structures in the spatial distributions of chemical species than the mesoscale simulations, highlighting the capability of LES to resolve high-resolution photochemical transformations in urban areas. Compared to the mesoscale model results, the LES simulations show similar evolutions in the profiles of the chemical species as a function of the boundary layer development over a diurnal cycle.},

WRF-LES statistics of concentration fluctuations in the daytime convective boundary layer were similar to data obtained from laboratory experiments and other LES models. However, poor turbulence resolution near the surface in neutral boundary layer simulations caused under prediction of mean dispersion in the crosswind horizontal direction and over prediction of concentration variance in the neutral surface layer. A gradient in the intermittency factor for concentration fluctuations was observed near the surface, downwind of ground-level sources in the daytime boundary layer. That observation suggests that the intermittency factor is a promising metric for estimating source-sensor distance in source determination applications.},

Coarse atmospheric models, which assume complete mixing within each grid-box, may overestimate the rates at which chemical species react. We used a large eddy simulation (LES) model embedded in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to assess the influence of species segregation on the photochemistry in the convective boundary layer. We implemented our model in the vicinity of Hong Kong Island, which is subject to strong turbulent flow and spatially inhomogeneous anthropogenic and biogenic emissions. We conclude that under heavy pollution conditions, segregation reduces the rate of the reaction between anthropogenic hydrocarbons and hydroxyl radical (OH) by 25\% near the surface in urban areas. Furthermore, under polluted conditions, segregation reduces the ozone production rate in the urbanized areas by 50\% at about 100 m above the surface. The reduction is only equal to 20\% near the surface in the forested mountain area. This highlights the need to develop grid refinement approaches in regional and global models in the vicinity of large urban areas with high pollution levels. Under clean conditions, our large eddy simulations suggest that the role of segregation is small and can be ignored in regional and global modelling approaches.},

However, in reality, these species are often segregated due to localized sources and the influence of topography. In order to investigate the degree to which the rates of chemical reactions between two reactive species are reduced due to the possible segregation of species within the convective boundary layer, we perform large-eddy simulations (LESs) in the mountainous region of Hong Kong Island. We adopt a simple chemical scheme with 15 primary and secondary chemical species, including ozone and its precursors. We calculate the segregation intensity due to inhomogeneity in the surface emissions of primary pollutants and due to turbulent motions related to topography. We show that the inhomogeneity in the emissions increases the segregation intensity by a factor of 2–5 relative to a case in which the emissions are assumed to be uniformly distributed. Topography has an important effect on the segregation locally, but this influence is relatively limited when considering the spatial domain as a whole. In the particular setting of our model, segregation reduces the ozone formation by 8 \%–12 \% compared to the case with complete mixing, implying that the coarse-resolution models may overestimate the surface ozone when ignoring the segregation effect.},

	abstract = {When two species A and B are introduced through different parts of the bounding surface into a region of turbulent flow, molecules of A and B are brought together by the combined actions of the turbulent velocity field and molecular diffusion. A random flight model is developed to simulate the relative motion of pairs of fluid elements and random motions of the molecules, based on the models of Durbin (1980) and Sawford \& Hunt (1986). The model is used to estimate the cross-correlation between fluctuating concentrations of A and B, \${\textbackslash}overline\{c\_Ac\_B\}\$, at a point, in non-premixed homogeneous turbulence with a moderately fast or slow second-order chemical reaction. The correlation indicates the effects of turbulent and molecular mixing on the mean chemical reaction rate, and it is commonly expressed as the ‘segregation’ or ‘unmixedness’ parameter \${\textbackslash}alpha(={\textbackslash}overline\{c\_Ac\_B\}/{\textbackslash}overline\{C\}\_A{\textbackslash}overline\{C\}\_B) \$ when normalized by the mean concentrations \${\textbackslash}overline\{C\}\_A\$ and \${\textbackslash}overline\{C\}\_B\$. It is found that α increases from near −1 to zero with the time (or distance) from the moment (or location) of release of two species in high-Reynolds-number flow. Also, the model (and experiments) agrees with the exact results of Danckwerts (1952) that \${\textbackslash}overline\{c\_Ac\_B\}/({\textbackslash}overline\{c{\textasciicircum}2\_A\}{\textbackslash}overline\{c{\textasciicircum}2\_B\}){\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}\} = -1\$ for mixing without reaction. The model is then extended to account for the effects on the segregation parameter α of chemical reactions between A and B. This leads to α eventually decreasing, depending on the relative timescales for turbulent mixing and for chemical reaction (i.e. the Damköhler number). The model also indicates how a number of other parameters such as the turbulent scales, the Schmidt number, the ratio of initial concentrations of two reactants and the mean shear affect the segregation parameter α.The model explains the measurements of α in previously published studies by ourselves and other authors, for mixing with and without reactions, provided that the reaction rate is not very fast. Also the model is only strictly applicable for a limited mixing time t, such that t [lsim    ] TL where TL is the Lagrangian timescale, because the model requires that the interface between A and B is effectively continuous and thin, even if highly convoluted. Flow visualization results are presented, which are consistent with the physical idea underlying the two-particle model.},

The essential reactions that account for the ozone formation and depletion are included in the chemical mechanism which, as a consequence, contains a wide range of timescales. The turbulent reacting flow is modeled with a large-eddy simulation (LES) code. The deviations from chemical equilibrium that are caused by turbulent motions are investigated in terms of the intensity of segregation. For the studied cases it is found that the volume-averaged concentrations calculated with the LES code agree well with the concentrations calculated with a box model. The reaction rate between RH (a generic hydrocarbon emitted at the surface) and OH is most strongly affected (3\% slower than in the box model). However, if RH is emitted nonuniformly at the surface, or if the RH-OH reaction rate is increased, the volume-averaged RH destruction by OH may be slowed down by as much as 30\% compared to a box model. Sensitivity studies showed that the intensity of segregation between RH and OH not only depends on the strength and spatial distribution of the RH emissions but also on the way NO is emitted in the model atmosphere. The results obtained indicate that the assumption that localized emissions of reactive hydrocarbons, for example, isoprene or terpenes, are instantaneously mixed may lead to an underestimation of their atmospheric lifetime.},

We study the interaction between chemistry and convective boundary layer turbulent with a large eddy simulation model coupled to CHIMERE, a detailed chemical model, over a 10×10km domain. Our results show that when emissions are concentrated over a limited area, strong values of segregation between chemical species are obtained over the first two active hours during the morning, leading to significant impact in terms of pollutants concentration.

This creates regions where the species are accumulated in a correlated or anti-correlated way, thereby modifying the mean reactivity. We quantify this modification by the intensity of segregation, IS, and analyse the driving mechanisms: heterogeneity of the surface moisture and heat fluxes, various background wind patterns and non-uniform isoprene emissions. The heterogeneous surface conditions are characterized by cool and wet forested patches with high isoprene emissions, alternated with warm and dry patches that represents pasture with relatively low isoprene emissions. For typical conditions in the Amazon rain forest, applying homogeneous surface forcings and in the absence of free tropospheric NOx, the isoprene-OH reaction rate is altered by less than 10\%. This is substantially smaller than the previously assumed IS of 50\% in recent large-scale model analyses of tropical rain forest chemistry. Spatial heterogeneous surface emissions enhance the segregation of species, leading to alterations of the chemical reaction rates up to 20\%. The intensities of segregation are enhanced when the background wind direction is parallel to the borders between the patches and reduced in the case of a perpendicular wind direction. The effects of segregation on trace gas concentrations vary per species. For the highly reactive OH, the differences in concentration averaged over the boundary layer are less than 2\% compared to homogeneous surface conditions, while the isoprene concentration is increased by as much as 12\% due to the reduced chemical reaction rates. These processes take place at the sub-grid scale of chemistry transport models and therefore need to be parameterized.},

We investigate the impact of turbulent mixing on isoprene-OH reactivity with large eddy simulations (LES) coupled with comprehensive chemistry. Our results show that the covariance of isoprene and OH causes 20\% decrease to 10\% increase of the horizontal average reaction rate, depending on nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) abundances, compared to the rate that neglects the covariance. This wide range of effects on reaction rates is caused by the primary production and loss reactions of OH in each NOx regime.

We simulate transport and chemistry for a meteorological case with a diurnal pattern of nonprecipitating cumulus clouds from the Baltimore-Washington area DISCOVER-AQ campaign. We evaluate two scenarios with and without aqueous-phase chemical reactions. In the cloud layer (2–3 km), the addition of aqueous phase reactions decreases HCHO by 18\% over the domain due to its solubility and the fast depletion from aqueous reactions, resulting in a corresponding decrease in radical oxidants (e.g., 18\% decrease in OH). The decrease of OH increases the mixing ratios of isoprene and methacrolein (MACR) (100\% and 15\%, respectively) in the cloud layer because the reaction rate is lower. Aqueous-phase reactions can modify the segregation between OH and BVOC by changing the sign of the segregation intensity, causing up to 55\% reduction in the isoprene-OH reaction rate and 40\% reduction for the MACR-OH reaction when clouds are present. Analysis of the isoprene-OH covariance budget shows the chemistry term is the primary driver of the strong segregation in clouds, triggered by the decrease in OH. All organic acids except acetic acid are formed only through aqueous-phase reactions. For acids formed in the aqueous phase, turbulence mixes these compounds on short time scales, with the near-surface mixing ratios of these acids reaching 20\% of the mixing ratios in the cloud layer within 1 h of cloud formation.},

	abstract = {Vertical mixing processes as simulated by atmospheric models affect the prediction of vertical profiles of reactive trace gases and oxidants and our understanding of atmospheric chemistry throughout the boundary layer. Specifically, the vertical transport of these oxidants is important for understanding where in situ chemistry occurs. Simulations of the vertical transport are influenced by many factors, including the horizontal and vertical grid resolution, planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes, and the use of cumulus parameterization to represent sub-grid scale cloud processes. Here, we compare simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) with the NCAR Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model and the NASA P-3B measurements over the Baltimore-Washington region to evaluate the performance of WRF-Chem in simulating vertical mixing of chemical oxidants in the PBL. For two different PBL schemes, WRF-Chem simulates a weaker convective environment and lower PBL height than LES. Comparing WRF simulations, the Yonsei University (YSU) PBL scheme simulates higher and drier PBL than the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ) PBL scheme. The stronger vertical mixing in the LES model simulates higher concentrations of chemical oxidants aloft than WRF-Chem, leading to a constant O3 vertical profile up to the top of the LES domain (4.8 km). Weaker vertical mixing in WRF-Chem prohibits upward transport of the key chemical precursors, therefore resulting in low in situ chemical production of O3 and OH aloft in the WRF-Chem simulations with both PBL schemes and reducing the oxidative capacity in the buffer or cloud layer.},

	abstract = {We employed direct numerical simulations to estimate the error on chemical calculation in simulations with regional chemical-transport models induced by neglecting subgrid chemical segregation due to inefficient turbulent mixing in an urban boundary layer with strong and heterogeneously distributed surface emissions. In simulations of initially segregated reactive species with an entrainment-emission configuration with an A–B–C second-order chemical scheme, urban surface emission fluxes of the homogeneously emitted tracer A result in a very large segregation between the tracers and hence a very large overestimation of the effective chemical reaction rate in a complete-mixing model. This large effect can be indicated by a large Damköhler number (Da) of the limiting reactant. With heterogeneous surface emissions of the two reactants, the resultant normalised boundary-layer-averaged effective chemical reaction rate is found to be in a Gaussian function of Da, and it is increasingly overestimated by the imposed rate with an increased horizontal scale of emission heterogeneity. Coarse-grid models with resolutions commensurable to regional models give reduced yet still significant errors for all simulations with homogeneous emissions. Such model improvement is more sensitive to the increased vertical resolution. However, such improvement cannot be seen for simulations with heterogeneous emissions when the horizontal resolution of the model cannot resolve emission heterogeneity. This work highlights particular conditions in which the ability to resolve chemical segregation is especially important when modelling urban environments.},

During the CBL development, the SC intensity increases before this threshold is met, whereas it decreases thereafter. The cases with different background wind speeds (U = 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 m s −1) and relatively large heterogeneity length scale (λ = 4.8 km) show that the SCs are strengthened by larger wind speeds when the heterogeneity length scale is so large that the threshold cannot be met during the CBL development.

A nonparametric estimator based on the kernel method aimed at measuring the intensity of segregation is proposed. Numerical benchmark tests, in the case of a Gaussian plume, are performed to study the suitability of this technique. The estimator works well, especially for small and moderate separation from the plume centreline and generally in the smooth parts of the estimated function. The effective reaction rate is computed and the percentage error emerges to be less than 5\% in the best estimation intervals, and less than 40\% in the worst. A method to reduce percentage error is introduced and improved performances are observed.

Large-eddy simulation (LES) has complemented measurement campaigns by serving as a controlled environment in which to study plume dynamics and sampling strategies. However, with few comparisons with controlled-release experiments, the accuracy of LES for modeling natural gas emissions is poorly characterized. In this paper, we evaluate LES from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model against Project Prairie Grass campaign measurements and surface layer similarity theory. Using WRF-LES, we simulate continuous emissions from 30 near-surface trace gas sources in two stability regimes: strong convection and weak convection. We examine the impact of grid resolutions ranging from 6.25 to 52 m in the horizontal dimension on model results. We evaluate performance in a statistical framework, calculating fractional bias and conducting Welch’s t tests. WRF-LES accurately simulates observed surface concentrations at 100 m and beyond under strong convection; simulated concentrations pass t tests in this region irrespective of grid resolution. However, in weakly convective conditions with strong winds, WRF-LES substantially overpredicts concentrations—the magnitude of fractional bias often exceeds 30\%, and all but one t test fails. The good performance of WRF-LES under strong convection correlates with agreement with local free convection theory and a minimal amount of parameterized turbulent kinetic energy. The poor performance under weak convection corresponds to misalignment with Monin–Obukhov similarity theory and a significant amount of parameterized turbulent kinetic energy.},

Most of these emissions are spatially heterogeneous at model grid scales. When remapped from low-resolution data, the spatial heterogeneity in emissions can be lost, leading to large errors in the simulation. It can also cause the conservation problem if non-conservative remapping is used. The default anthropogenic emission treatment in Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) is subject to both problems. In this study, we introduce a revised emission treatment for the E3SM atmosphere model (EAM) that ensures conservation of mass fluxes and preserves the original emission heterogeneity at the model-resolved grid scale. We assess the error estimates associated with the default emission treatment and the impact of improved heterogeneity and mass conservation in both globally uniform standard-resolution ({\textasciitilde}165 km) and regionally-refined high-resolution ({\textasciitilde}42 km) simulations. The default treatment incurs significant errors near surface, particularly over sharp emission gradient zones. Much larger errors are observed in high-resolution simulations. It substantially underestimates the aerosol burden, surface concentration, and aerosol sources over highly polluted regions, while overestimates these quantities over less-polluted adjacent areas. Large errors can persist at higher elevation for daily mean estimates, which can affect aerosol extinction profiles and aerosol optical depth (AOD). We find that the revised treatment significantly improves the accuracy of the aerosol emissions from surface and elevated sources near sharp spatial gradient regions, with significant improvement in the spatial heterogeneity and variability of simulated surface concentration in high-resolution simulations. In the next-generation E3SM running at convection-permitting scales where the resolved spatial heterogeneity is significantly increased, the revised emission treatment is expected to be better represent the aerosol emissions as well as their lifecycle and impacts on climate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The lumped-structure approach for condensing organic chemical mechanisms is attractive, since it yields fewer species and reactions and reduces computational costs. This paper leads through the development of a new lumped-structure mechanism, largely based on the widely used Carbon Bond Mechanism (CBM-IV) developed by Gery et al. [1989]. The new mechanism called CBM-Z extends the original framework to function properly at larger spatial and longer timescales. The major modifications in the mechanism include revised inorganic chemistry; explicit treatment of the lesser reactive paraffins, methane and ethane; revised parameterizations of the reactive paraffin, olefin, and aromatic reactions; inclusion of alkyl and acyl peroxy radical interactions and their reactions with NO3; inclusion of organic nitrates and hydroperoxides; and refined isoprene chemistry based on the condensed one-product mechanism of Carter [1996]. CBM-Z was successfully evaluated along with the CBM-IV, a partially revised CBM-IV, and a revised Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM2) mechanism [Stockwell et al., 1990; Kirchner and Stockwell, 1996] using the low NOx and volatile organic compound concentration smog chamber experiments of Simonaitis et al. [1997]. Box model versions of the four mechanisms were also evaluated under a variety of hypothetical urban and rural scenarios for a period of 30 days. Results from CBM-Z and revised RADM2 were found to be within ±20\% of each other, while CBM-IV and revised CBM-IV results deviated significantly by up to 50–95\%. Sensitivity tests were performed to elucidate the effects of some of the new features added in CBM-Z. Relative computational memory and time requirements of these mechanisms are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Development and application of a new Multicomponent Equilibrium Solver for Aerosols (MESA) is described for systems containing H+, NH4+, Na+, Ca2+, SO42−, HSO4−, NO3−, and Cl− ions. The equilibrium solution is obtained by integrating a set of pseudo-transient ordinary differential equations describing the precipitation and dissolution reactions for all the possible salts to steady state. A comprehensive temperature dependent mutual deliquescence relative humidity (MDRH) parameterization is developed for all the possible salt mixtures, thereby eliminating the need for a rigorous numerical solution when ambient RH is less than MDRH(T). The solver is unconditionally stable, mass conserving, and shows robust convergence. Performance of MESA was evaluated against the Web-based AIM Model III, which served as a benchmark for accuracy, and the EQUISOLV II solver for speed. Important differences in the convergence and thermodynamic errors in MESA and EQUISOLV II are discussed. The average ratios of speeds of MESA over EQUISOLV II ranged between 1.4 and 5.8, with minimum and maximum ratios of 0.6 and 17, respectively. Because MESA directly diagnoses MDRH, it is significantly more efficient when RH {\textless} MDRH. MESA's superior performance is partially due to its “hard-wired” code for the present system as opposed to EQUISOLV II, which has a more generalized structure for solving any number and type of reactions at temperatures down to 190 K. These considerations suggest that MESA is highly attractive for use in 3-D aerosol/air-quality models for lower tropospheric applications (T {\textgreater} 240 K) in which both accuracy and computational efficiency are critical.},

The mixing state index χ enables the first rigorous definition of the spectrum of mixing states from so-called external mixture to internal mixture, which is significant for aerosol climate impacts, including aerosol optical properties and cloud condensation nuclei activity. We illustrate the usefulness of this new mixing state framework with model results from the stochastic particle-resolved model PartMC-MOSAIC. These results demonstrate how the mixing state metrics evolve with time for several archetypal cases, each of which isolates a specific process such as coagulation, emission, or condensation. Further, we present an analysis of the mixing state evolution for a complex urban plume case, for which these processes occur simultaneously. We additionally derive theoretical properties of the mixing state index and present a family of generalized mixing state indexes that vary in the importance assigned to low-mass-fraction species.},

	abstract = {A flexible treatment for gas- and aerosol-phase chemical processes has been developed for models of diverse scale, from box models up to global models. At the core of this novel framework is an “abstracted aerosol representation” that allows a given chemical mechanism to be solved in atmospheric models with different aerosol representations (e.g., sectional, modal, or particle-resolved). This is accomplished by treating aerosols as a collection of condensed phases that are implemented according to the aerosol representation of the host model. The framework also allows multiple chemical processes (e.g., gas- and aerosol-phase chemical reactions, emissions, deposition, photolysis, and mass transfer) to be solved simultaneously as a single system. The flexibility of the model is achieved by (1) using an object-oriented design that facilitates extensibility to new types of chemical processes and to new ways of representing aerosol systems, (2) runtime model configuration using JSON input files that permits making changes to any part of the chemical mechanism without recompiling the model (this widely used, human-readable format allows entire gas- and aerosol-phase chemical mechanisms to be described with as much complexity as necessary), and (3) automated comprehensive testing that ensures stability of the code as new functionality is introduced. Together, these design choices enable users to build a customized multiphase mechanism without having to handle preprocessors, solvers, or compilers. Removing these hurdles makes this type of modeling accessible to a much wider community, including modelers, experimentalists, and educators. This new treatment compiles as a stand-alone library and has been deployed in the particle-resolved PartMC model and in the Multiscale Online AtmospheRe CHemistry (MONARCH) chemical weather prediction system for use at regional and global scales. Results from the initial deployment to box models of different complexity and MONARCH will be discussed, along with future extension to more complex gas–aerosol systems and the integration of GPU-based solvers.},

	abstract = {Biomass burning is a significant global source of aerosol number and mass. In fresh biomass burning plumes, aerosol coagulation reduces aerosol number and increases the median size of aerosol size distributions, impacting aerosol radiative effects. Near-source biomass burning aerosol coagulation occurs at spatial scales much smaller than the grid boxes of global and many regional models. To date, these models have ignored sub-grid coagulation and instantly mixed fresh biomass burning emissions into coarse grid boxes. A previous study found that the rate of particle growth by coagulation within an individual smoke plume can be approximated using the aerosol mass emissions rate, initial size distribution median diameter and modal width, plume mixing depth, and wind speed. In this paper, we use this parameterization of sub-grid coagulation in the GEOS-Chem–TOMAS (TwO-Moment Aerosol Sectional) global aerosol microphysics model to quantify the impacts on global aerosol size distributions, the direct radiative effect, and the cloud-albedo aerosol indirect effect.

 We find that inclusion of biomass burning sub-grid coagulation reduces the biomass burning impact on the number concentration of particles larger than 80\&thinsp;nm (a proxy for CCN-sized particles) by 37\&thinsp;\% globally. This cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) reduction causes our estimated global biomass burning cloud-albedo aerosol indirect effect to decrease from −76 to −43\&thinsp;mW\&thinsp;m−2. Further, as sub-grid coagulation moves mass to sizes with more efficient scattering, including it increases our estimated biomass burning all-sky direct effect from −224 to −231\&thinsp;mW\&thinsp;m−2, with assumed external mixing of black carbon and from −188 to −197\&thinsp;mW\&thinsp;m−2 and with assumed internal mixing of black carbon with core-shell morphology. However, due to differences in fire and meteorological conditions across regions, the impact of sub-grid coagulation is not globally uniform. We also test the sensitivity of the impact of sub-grid coagulation to two different biomass burning emission inventories to various assumptions about the fresh biomass burning aerosol size distribution and to two different timescales of sub-grid coagulation. The impacts of sub-grid coagulation are qualitatively the same regardless of these assumptions.},

	abstract = {Biomass-burning aerosols have a significant effect on global and regional aerosol climate forcings. To model the magnitude of these effects accurately requires knowledge of the size distribution of the emitted and evolving aerosol particles. Current biomass-burning inventories do not include size distributions, and global and regional models generally assume a fixed size distribution from all biomass-burning emissions. However, biomass-burning size distributions evolve in the plume due to coagulation and net organic aerosol (OA) evaporation or formation, and the plume processes occur on spacial scales smaller than global/regional-model grid boxes. The extent of this size-distribution evolution is dependent on a variety of factors relating to the emission source and atmospheric conditions. Therefore, accurately accounting for biomass-burning aerosol size in global models requires an effective aerosol size distribution that accounts for this sub-grid evolution and can be derived from available emission-inventory and meteorological parameters.

 In this paper, we perform a detailed investigation of the effects of coagulation on the aerosol size distribution in biomass-burning plumes. We compare the effect of coagulation to that of OA evaporation and formation. We develop coagulation-only parameterizations for effective biomass-burning size distributions using the SAM-TOMAS large-eddy simulation plume model. For the most-sophisticated parameterization, we use the Gaussian Emulation Machine for Sensitivity Analysis (GEM-SA) to build a parameterization of the aged size distribution based on the SAM-TOMAS output and seven inputs: emission median dry diameter, emission distribution modal width, mass emissions flux, fire area, mean boundary-layer wind speed, plume mixing depth, and time/distance since emission. This parameterization was tested against an independent set of SAM-TOMAS simulations and yields R2 values of 0.83 and 0.89 for Dpm and modal width, respectively. The size distribution is particularly sensitive to the mass emissions flux, fire area, wind speed, and time, and we provide simplified fits of the aged size distribution to just these input variables. The simplified fits were tested against 11 aged biomass-burning size distributions observed at the Mt. Bachelor Observatory in August 2015. The simple fits captured over half of the variability in observed Dpm and modal width even though the freshly emitted Dpm and modal widths were unknown. These fits may be used in global and regional aerosol models. Finally, we show that coagulation generally leads to greater changes in the particle size distribution than OA evaporation/formation does, using estimates of OA production/loss from the literature.},

 We find that inclusion of biomass burning sub-grid coagulation reduces the biomass burning impact on the number concentration of particles larger than 80\&thinsp;nm (a proxy for CCN-sized particles) by 37\&thinsp;\% globally. This cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) reduction causes our estimated global biomass burning cloud-albedo aerosol indirect effect to decrease from −76 to −43\&thinsp;mW\&thinsp;m−2. Further, as sub-grid coagulation moves mass to sizes with more efficient scattering, including it increases our estimated biomass burning all-sky direct effect from −224 to −231\&thinsp;mW\&thinsp;m−2, with assumed external mixing of black carbon and from −188 to −197\&thinsp;mW\&thinsp;m−2 and with assumed internal mixing of black carbon with core-shell morphology. However, due to differences in fire and meteorological conditions across regions, the impact of sub-grid coagulation is not globally uniform. We also test the sensitivity of the impact of sub-grid coagulation to two different biomass burning emission inventories to various assumptions about the fresh biomass burning aerosol size distribution and to two different timescales of sub-grid coagulation.

	abstract = {Limited area (regional) models applied at high resolution over specific regions of interest are generally expected to more accurately capture the spatiotemporal variability of key meteorological and climate parameters. However, improved performance is not inevitable, and there remains a need to optimize use of numerical resources and to quantify the impact on simulation fidelity that derives from increased resolution. The application of regional models for climate forcing assessment is currently limited by the lack of studies quantifying the sensitivity to horizontal spatial resolution and the physical\&ndash;dynamical\&ndash;chemical schemes driving the simulations. Here we investigate model skill in simulating meteorological, chemical and aerosol properties as a function of spatial resolution, by applying the Weather Research and Forecasting model with coupled Chemistry (WRF-Chem) over eastern North America at different resolutions. Using Brier skill scores and other statistical metrics it is shown that enhanced resolution (from 60 to 12 km) improves model performance for all of the meteorological parameters and gas-phase concentrations considered, in addition to both mean and extreme aerosol optical depth (AOD) in three wavelengths in the visible relative to satellite observations, principally via increase of potential skill. Some of the enhanced model performance for AOD appears to be attributable to improved simulation of meteorological conditions and the concentration of key aerosol precursor gases (e.g., SO2 and NH3). Among other reasons, a dry bias in the specific humidity in the boundary layer and a substantial underestimation of total monthly precipitation in the 60 km simulations are identified as causes for the better performance of WRF-Chem simulations at 12 km.},

	abstract = {Abstract A numerical experiment with a general circulation model with a simple hydrologic cycle is performed. The basic framework of this model is identical with that adopted for the previous study [35] except for the incorporation of a simplified hydrologic cycle which consists of the advection of water vapor by large-scale motion, evaporation from the surface, precipitation and an artificial adjustment to simulate the process of moist convection. This adjustment is performed only when the relative humidity reaches 100 percent and the lapse rate exceeds the moist adiabatic lapse rate. The radiative flux is computed for the climatological distribution of water vapor instead of using the distribution calculated by the prognostic equation of water vapor. A completely wet surface without any heat capacity is chosen as the lower boundary. The initial conditions consist of a completely dry and isothermal atmosphere. A state of quasi-equilibrium is obtained as a result of the time integration of 187 days. A preliminary analysis of the result is performed for the 40-day period from 148th day to 187th day. According to this analysis, the hemispheric mean of the rate of precipitation is about 1.06 m./yr. which is close to the estimate of the annual mean rainfall obtained by Budyko [5]. In the Tropics rainfall exceeds evaporation and in the subtropics the latter exceeds the former in qualitative agreement with observation. The difference between them, however, is too exaggerated, and an extremely large export of water vapor from the dry subtropics into the wet, Tropics by the meridional circulation takes place. In the troposphere, relative humidity increases with decreasing altitude. In the stratosphere it is very low except at the tropical tropopause, and the mixing ratio of water vapor is extremely small in qualitative agreement with observation. Although water vapor is transported from the troposphere into the stratosphere, it is then transported toward low latitudes and condenses at the tropical tropopause where the temperature is very low and the relative humidity is high. Based upon a harmonic analysis of the flow field and the surface pressure field, it, is concluded that the effect of condensation tends to increase the wave number of the tropospheric flow and surface pressure field. Also, the incorporation of the moist process in the model seems to increase the intensity of meridional circulation in the Tropics. As a result of this increase, the transport of momentum and heat by the meridional circulation in the Tropics is much larger than that obtained from the previous study. In middle latitudes, the poleward transport of total energy in the moist-model atmosphere is less than that in the dry-model atmosphere because of the effect of the poleward transport of Intent energy or the heat of condensation. The latitudinal distributions of radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere and at the earth's surface coincide very well with those obtained by London [17] for the actual atmosphere. Bowen's ratio increases with increasing latitude and its magnitude coincides reasonably well with that obtained by Budyko [5] or Jacobs [11] for the ocean surface.},

	abstract = {Recent improvements to many global climate models include detailed, prognostic aerosol calculations intended to better reproduce the observed climate. However, the trace gas and aerosol fields are treated at the grid cell scale with no attempt to account for subgrid impacts on the aerosol fields. This paper begins to quantify the error introduced by the neglected subgrid variability for the shortwave direct aerosol radiative forcing for a representative climate model grid spacing of 75 km. An analysis of the value added in downscaling aerosol fields is also presented to give context to the WRF-Chem simulations used for the subgrid analysis. We found that the impact of neglected subgrid variability on the direct aerosol radiative forcing is strongest in regions of complex topography and complicated flow patterns. Evidence also suggests that scale-induced differences in emissions, particularly for emissions calculated online, such as dust, contribute strongly to the impact of neglected subgrid processes on the aerosol radiative forcing. The two of these effects together, when simulated at 75 km versus 3 km in WRF-Chem, result in an average daytime mean bias of over 30\% error in top-of-atmosphere shortwave direct aerosol radiative forcing for a large percentage of central Mexico during the Megacity Initiative: Local and Global Research Observations (MILAGRO) field campaign and an average mean bias of 10\% when averaged over the entire analysis region and 17 day period.},

	abstract = {One fundamental property and limitation of grid based models is their inability to identify spatial details smaller than the grid cell size. While decades of work have gone into developing sub-grid treatments for clouds and land surface processes in climate models, the quantitative understanding of sub-grid processes and variability for aerosols and their precursors is much poorer. In this study, WRF-Chem is used to simulate the trace gases and aerosols over central Mexico during the 2006 MILAGRO field campaign, with multiple spatial resolutions and emission/terrain scenarios. Our analysis focuses on quantifying the sub-grid variability (SGV) of trace gases and aerosols within a typical global climate model grid cell, i.e. 75\&times;75 km2. 

 Our results suggest that a simulation with 3-km horizontal grid spacing adequately reproduces the overall transport and mixing of trace gases and aerosols downwind of Mexico City, while 75-km horizontal grid spacing is insufficient to represent local emission and terrain-induced flows along the mountain ridge, subsequently affecting the transport and mixing of plumes from nearby sources. Therefore, the coarse model grid cell average may not correctly represent aerosol properties measured over polluted areas. Probability density functions (PDFs) for trace gases and aerosols show that secondary trace gases and aerosols, such as O3, sulfate, ammonium, and nitrate, are more likely to have a relatively uniform probability distribution (i.e. smaller SGV) over a narrow range of concentration values. Mostly inert and long-lived trace gases and aerosols, such as CO and BC, are more likely to have broad and skewed distributions (i.e. larger SGV) over polluted regions. Over remote areas, all trace gases and aerosols are more uniformly distributed compared to polluted areas. Both CO and O3 SGV vertical profiles are nearly constant within the PBL during daytime, indicating that trace gases are very efficiently transported and mixed vertically by turbulence. But, simulated horizontal variability indicates that trace gases and aerosols are not well mixed horizontally in the PBL. During nighttime the SGV for trace gases is maximum at the surface, and quickly decreases with height. Unlike the trace gases, the SGV of BC and secondary aerosols reaches a maximum at the PBL top during the day. The SGV decreases with distance away from the polluted urban area, has a more rapid decrease for long-lived trace gases and aerosols than for secondary ones, and is greater during daytime than nighttime. 

 The SGV of trace gases and aerosols is generally larger than for meteorological quantities. Emissions can account for up to 50\% of the SGV over urban areas such as Mexico City during daytime for less-reactive trace gases and aerosols, such as CO and BC. The impact of emission spatial variability on SGV decays with altitude in the PBL and is insignificant in the free troposphere. The emission variability affects SGV more significantly during daytime (rather than nighttime) and over urban (rather than rural or remote) areas. The terrain, through its impact on meteorological fields such as wind and the PBL structure, affects dispersion and transport of trace gases and aerosols and their SGV.},

	abstract = {Approaches to subgrid-scale physical parameterization in atmospheric modeling are reviewed by taking turbulent combustion flow research as a point of reference. Three major general approaches are considered for its consistent development: moment, distribution density function (DDF), and mode decomposition. The moment expansion is a standard method for describing the subgrid-scale turbulent flows both in geophysics and engineering. The DDF (commonly called PDF) approach is intuitively appealing as it deals with a distribution of variables in subgrid scale in a more direct manner. Mode decomposition was originally applied by Aubry et al (1988 J. Fluid Mech. 192 115-73) in the context of wall boundary-layer turbulence. It is specifically designed to represent coherencies in compact manner by a low-dimensional dynamical system. Their original proposal adopts the proper orthogonal decomposition (empirical orthogonal functions) as their mode-decomposition basis. However, the methodology can easily be generalized into any decomposition basis. Among those, wavelet is a particularly attractive alternative. The mass-flux formulation that is currently adopted in the majority of atmospheric models for parameterizing convection can also be considered a special case of mode decomposition, adopting segmentally constant modes for the expansion basis. This perspective further identifies a very basic but also general geometrical constraint imposed on the massflux formulation: the segmentally-constant approximation. Mode decomposition can, furthermore, be understood by analogy with a Galerkin method in numerically modeling. This analogy suggests that the subgrid parameterization may be re-interpreted as a type of mesh-refinement in numerical modeling. A link between the subgrid parameterization and downscaling problems is also pointed out.},

The model is based on the derivation of the sub-grid contribution of emission and the use of the concentration variance equation to transport it in the atmospheric boundary layer. The model has been implemented in an existing mesoscale model and the results compared with Large-Eddy Simulation data for ad-hoc simulation devised to test specifically the parametrization. The results show an excellent agreement of the models. For the first time a time evolving error bar reproducing the sub-grid scale heterogeneity of the emissions and the way in which it affects the concentration has been shown. The concentration variance is presented as an extra attribute to better define the mean concentrations in a Reynolds-average model. The model has applications from meso to global scale and that go beyond air quality.},

The approach can be used in three-dimensional chemical transport models (CTMs) of all scales, from urban to global. The parameterization's results are evaluated against the predictions of a detailed one-dimensional aerosol dynamics model under a variety of atmospheric conditions. The parameterization agrees well with the dynamic model when the mean emitted particle size is smaller than that of the existing particles.

	abstract = {A fundamental limitation of grid-based models is their inability to resolve variability on scales smaller than a grid box. Past research has shown that significant aerosol variability exists on scales smaller than these grid boxes, which can lead to discrepancies in simulated aerosol climate effects between high- and low-resolution models. This study investigates the impact of neglecting subgrid variability in present-day global microphysical aerosol models on aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). We introduce a novel technique to isolate the effect of aerosol variability from other sources of model variability by varying the resolution of aerosol and trace gas fields while maintaining a constant resolution in the rest of the model. 

 We compare WRF-Chem (Weather and Research Forecast model) runs in which aerosol and gases are simulated at 80 km and again at 10 km resolutions; in both simulations the other model components, such as meteorology and dynamics, are kept at the 10 km baseline resolution. We find that AOD is underestimated by 13 \% and CCN is overestimated by 27 \% when aerosol and gases are simulated at 80 km resolution compared to 10 km. The processes most affected by neglecting aerosol subgrid variability are gas-phase chemistry and aerosol uptake of water through aerosol–gas equilibrium reactions. The inherent non-linearities in these processes result in large changes in aerosol properties when aerosol and gaseous species are artificially mixed over large spatial scales. These changes in aerosol and gas concentrations are exaggerated by convective transport, which transports these altered concentrations to altitudes where their effect is more pronounced. These results demonstrate that aerosol variability can have a large impact on simulating aerosol climate effects, even when meteorology and dynamics are held constant. Future aerosol model development should focus on accounting for the effect of subgrid variability on these processes at global scales in order to improve model predictions of the aerosol effect on climate.},

To inform the development of an aerosol subgrid variability parameterization, here we analyze the aerosol SGV over the southern Pacific Ocean simulated by the high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled to Chemistry. We find that within a typical GCM grid, the aerosol mass subgrid standard deviation is 15\% of the grid-box mean mass near the surface on a 1 month mean basis. The fraction can increase to 50\% in the free troposphere. The relationships between the sea-salt mass concentration, meteorological variables, and sea-salt emission rate are investigated in both the clear and cloudy portion. Under clear-sky conditions, marine aerosol subgrid standard deviation is highly correlated with the standard deviations of vertical velocity, cloud water mixing ratio, and sea-salt emission rates near the surface. It is also strongly connected to the grid box mean aerosol in the free troposphere (between 2 km and 4 km). In the cloudy area, interstitial sea-salt aerosol mass concentrations are smaller, but higher correlation is found between the subgrid standard deviations of aerosol mass and vertical velocity. Additionally, we find that decreasing the model grid resolution can reduce the marine aerosol SGV but strengthen the correlations between the aerosol SGV and the total water mixing ratio (sum of water vapor, cloud liquid, and cloud ice mixing ratios).},

	abstract = {The particle-to-particle heterogeneity in aerosol hygroscopicity is crucial for understanding aerosol climatic and environmental effects. The hygroscopic parameter κ, widely applied to describe the hygroscopicity for aerosols both in models and observations, is a probability distribution highly related to aerosol heterogeneity due to the complex sources and aging processes. However, the heterogeneity in aerosol hygroscopicity is not adequately represented in observations and model simulations, leading to challenges in accurately estimating aerosol climatic and environmental effects. Here, we propose an algorithm for quantifying the particle-to-particle heterogeneity in aerosol hygroscopicity, based on information-theoretic entropy measures, by using the data that come only from the in situ measurement of the hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer (H-TDMA). Aerosols in this algorithm are assumed to be simple binary systems consisting of the less hygroscopic and more hygroscopic components, which are commonly used in H-TDMA measurement. Three indices, including the average per-particle species diversity Dα, the bulk population species diversity Dγ, and their affine ratio χ are calculated from the probability distribution of κ to describe aerosol heterogeneity. This algorithm can efficiently characterize the evolution of aerosol heterogeneity with time in the real atmosphere. Our results show that the heterogeneity varies much with aerosol particle size, and large discrepancies exist in the width and peak value of particle number size distribution (PNSD) with varied heterogeneity after hygroscopic growth, especially for conditions with high relative humidity. This reveals a vital role of the heterogeneity in ambient PNSD and significant uncertainties in calculating the climate-relevant properties if the population-averaged hygroscopicity is applied by neglecting its heterogeneity. This work points the way toward a better understanding of the role of hygroscopicity in evaluating aerosol climatic and environmental impacts.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Aerosols have a significant effect on the global radiation budget through their interactions with radiation and clouds. However, estimates of their effect are the dominant source of uncertainty in current estimates of total anthropogenic effect on climate. A major cause of this uncertainty is the high degree of variability of aerosol properties and processes that affect their lifetime. Prediction of the aerosol effect on climate depends on the ability of three-dimensional numerical models to accurately estimate aerosol properties. However, a limitation of traditional grid-based models is their inability to resolve variability on scales smaller than a grid box. Past research has shown that significant aerosol variability exists on scales smaller than these grid-boxes, which can lead to discrepancies between observations and aerosol models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}This thesis uses a synthesis of aerosol observations, global climate model (GCM) data, and a new aerosol modelling technique implemented within a regional-scale model to quantify the important scales of aerosol variability and the extent to which different sub-grid scale processes contribute to discrepancies in aerosol modelling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Analysis of black carbon (BC) plumes from aircraft observations shows that BC plumes represent a large portion of total BC mass and typically exist on scales of 65\{\vphantom{\}} 100 km. Comparison of observed plume scales to those simulated by GCMs at multiple resolutions show that GCMs overestimate the scales of along- ight-track variability by 64\% at the highest resolution. Variability is shown to be greater near sources than in remote regions, indicating that models may benefit from higher resolutions in regions of high emissions. Additionally, GCMs at all resolutions show higher variability in the latitudinal direction than the longitudinal direction, suggesting that capturing latitudinal variability may result in greater improvements in aerosol modelling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}This work additionally presents a novel technique to allow one to isolate the effect of aerosol variability from other sources of variability within the model. Processes most affected by neglecting aerosol sub-grid variability are gas-phase chemistry and aerosol uptake of water through the aerosol/gas equilibrium reactions. The inherent non-linearities in these processes result in large changes in aerosol parameters when aerosol and gaseous species are artificially mixed over large spatial scales. These changes in aerosol and gas concentrations are exaggerated by convective transport, which transports these altered concentrations to altitudes where their effect is more pronounced. Future aerosol model development should focus on accounting for the effect of sub-grid variability on these processes at global scales in order to improve model predictions of the aerosol effect on climate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The effects of chemistry on the transport and the mixing of reacting scalars in the convective atmospheric boundary layer (CBL) are investigated. To do this, we use large-eddy simulation (LES) to calculate explicitly the different terms of the flux and (co-)variance budget equations and to analyse in particular the role of the chemical term with respect to the thermodynamical terms. We examine a set of chemical cases that are representative of various turbulent reacting flows. The chemical scheme involves two reacting scalars undergoing a second-order reaction. In addition, we study a chemical cycle, based on a first- and a second-order reaction, to study the behaviour of chemical systems in equilibrium in turbulent flows. From the budget analysis, we found that the chemical terms become more relevant when the chemical timescale is similar to the turbulent timescale. In order to determine the importance of the chemical terms, we compared these terms to the dynamical terms of the budget equations. For the flux of reactants, the chemical term becomes the dominant sink in the bulk of the CBL. As a result, flux profiles of reacting scalars have non-linear shapes. For the covariance, which accounts for the segregation of species in the CBL, the chemical term can act as a sink or source term. Consequently, reacting scalar covariance profiles deviate considerably from the inert scalar profile. When the chemistry is in equilibrium, the chemical term becomes negligible and therefore the flux and (co-)variance profiles are similar to those of inert scalrs. On the basis of the previous budget results, we develop a parameterisation that represents the segregation of reacting species in large-scale models under convective conditions. The parameterisation is applied to an atmospheric chemical mechanism that accounts for ozone formation and depletion in the CBL. We found a good agreement between the parameterisation and the LES results.},

	abstract = {Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) such as isoprene constitute a large proportion of the global atmospheric oxidant sink. Their reactions in the atmosphere contribute to processes such as ozone production and secondary organic aerosol formation. However, over the tropical rainforest, where 50 \% of the global emissions of BVOCs are believed to occur, atmospheric chemistry models have been unable to simulate concurrently the measured daytime concentration of isoprene and that of its principal oxidant, hydroxyl (OH). One reason for this model-measurement discrepancy may be incomplete mixing of isoprene within the convective boundary layer, leading to patchiness or segregation in isoprene and OH mixing ratios and average concentrations that appear to be incompatible with each other. One way of capturing this effect in models of atmospheric chemistry is to use a reduced effective rate constant for their reaction. Recent studies comparing atmospheric chemistry global/box models with field measurements have suggested that this effective rate reduction may be as large as 50 \%; which is at the upper limit of that calculated using large eddy simulation models. To date there has only been one field campaign worldwide that has reported co-located measurements of isoprene and OH at the necessary temporal resolution to calculate the segregation of these compounds. However many campaigns have recorded sufficiently high resolution isoprene measurements to capture the small-scale fluctuations in its concentration. Assuming uniform distributions of other OH production and loss processes, we use a box model of atmospheric chemistry, constrained by the spectrum of isoprene concentrations measured, as a virtual instrument, to estimate the variability in OH at a point and hence, to estimate the segregation intensity of isoprene and OH from high-frequency isoprene time series. The method successfully reproduces the only directly observed segregation, using measurements made in a deciduous forest in Germany. The effective rate constant reduction for the reaction of isoprene and OH over a South-East Asian rainforest is calculated to be typically \&lt;15 \%. Although there are many unconstrained uncertainties, the likely nature of those processes suggests that this value represents an upper limit. The estimate is not sensitive to heterogeneities in NO at this remote site, unless they are correlated with those of isoprene, or to OH-recycling schemes in the isoprene oxidation mechanism, unless the recycling happens in the first reaction step. Segregation alone is therefore unlikely to be the sole cause of model-measurement discrepancies for isoprene and OH above a rainforest.},

	abstract = {An inhomogeneous mixing of reactants causes a reduction of their chemical removal compared to the homogeneously mixed case in turbulent atmospheric flows. This can be described by the intensity of segregation IS being the covariance of the mixing ratios of two species divided by the product of their means. Both terms appear in the balance equation of the mixing ratio and are discussed for the reaction between isoprene and OH for data of the field study ECHO 2003 above a deciduous forest. For most of these data, IS is negatively correlated with the fraction of mean OH mixing ratio reacting with isoprene. IS is also negatively correlated with the isoprene standard deviation. Both findings agree with model results discussed by Patton et al. (2001) and others. The correlation coefficient between OH and isoprene and, therefore, IS increases with increasing mean reaction rate. In addition, the balance equation of the covariance between isoprene and OH is applied as the theoretical framework for the analysis of the same field data. The storage term is small, and, therefore, a diagnostic equation for this covariance can be derived. The chemical reaction term Rij is dominated by the variance of isoprene times the quotient of mixing ratios of OH and isoprene. Based on these findings a new diagnostic equation for IS is formulated. Comparing different terms of this equation, IS and Rij show a relation also to the normalised isoprene standard deviation. It is shown that not only chemistry but also turbulent and convective mixing and advection – considered in a residual term – influence IS. Despite this finding, a detection of the influence of coherent eddy transport above the forest according to Katul et al. (1997) on IS fails, but a relation to the turbulent and advective transport of isoprene variance is determined. The largest values of IS are found for most unstable conditions with increasing buoyant production, confirming qualitatively model predictions by Ouwersloot et al. (2011).},

	abstract = {Abstract The influence of convective turbulence on chemical reactions in the atmospheric boundary layer is studied by means of direct numerical simulation (DNS). An archetype of turbulent reacting flows is used to study the reaction zones and to obtain a description of the turbulent control of chemical reactions. Several simulations are carried out and classified using a turbulent Damköhler number and a Kolmogorov Damköhler number. Using a classification based on these numbers, it is shown that it is possible to represent and to solve adequately all relevant scales of turbulence and chemistry by means of DNS. The simulations show clearly that the reaction zones are located near the boundaries where the species are introduced. At the lower boundary of the convective boundary layer, the reaction takes place predominantly in the core of the updrafts, whereas in the upper part of the domain the chemical reaction is greatest in the center of the downdrafts. In the bulk of the boundary layer the chemical reaction proceeds very slowly, due to the almost complete segregation of the chemical species. From the point of view of chemistry, the mixing across the interface between updrafts and downdrafts in the bulk of the convective boundary layer plays only a minor role. The amount of chemical reaction in relation to the degree of turbulence is quantified by the introduction of an effective Damköhler number. This dimensionless number explicitly takes into account the reduction of the reaction rate due to the segregation of the chemical species. It is shown that the number approaches an asymptotic value that is O(1) for increasingly fast reaction rates. This shows explicitly that the timescale of the chemical reactions is limited by the integral turbulent timescale. It is suggested how a parameterization could be used to include this effect into one-dimensional atmospheric models.},

The sub-grid scale emission variability is assimilated in the model as a PDF of the emissions. The stochastic fields method shows excellent agreement with the LES data without adjustment of the constants used in the mesoscale model. The stochastic fields method is a stochastic solution of the transport equations for the concentration PDF of dispersing scalars, therefore it possesses the ability to handle chemistry of any complexity without the need to introduce additional closures for the high order statistics of chemical species.

Different subgrid concentrations are calculated inside each one of these environments providing a direct estimate of pollutant variability along with the ‘standard’ grid-averaged model output. The method was first validated over a controlled emissions case by comparing concentrations modeled in the subgrid-environments with concentrations modeled directly at higher model resolution and next over a real case-study, where subgrid concentrations were compared with monitor data from sites representing different types of urban environments (i.e. roads and residential blocks).

Concentration fluctuations are relevant in many fields including the evaluation of toxicity, flammability, and odour nuisance. Characterizing concentration fluctuations requires not just the mean concentration but also at least the variance of the concentration in the location of interest. However, for most purposes the characterization of the concentration fluctuations requires knowledge of the concentration probability density function (PDF) in the point of interest and even the time evolution of the concentration. We firstly review the experimental works made both in the field and in the laboratory, and cover both point sources and line sources. Regarding modelling approaches, we cover analytical, semi-analytical, and numerical methods. For clarity of presentation we subdivide the models in two groups, models linked to a transport equation, which usually require a numerical resolution, and models mainly based on phenomenological aspects of dispersion, often providing analytical or semi-analytical relations. The former group includes: large-eddy simulations, Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes methods, two-particle Lagrangian stochastic models, PDF transport equation methods, and heuristic Lagrangian single-particle methods. The latter group includes: fluctuating plume models, semi-empirical models for the concentration moments, analytical models for the concentration PDF, and concentration time-series models. We close the review with a brief discussion highlighting possible useful additions to experiments and improvements to models.},

We focus on the two most commonly used complexity metrics in ecology: fractal dimension and rugosity. We discuss the pros and cons of these metrics using practical examples from our own empirical data and from simulations. Fractal dimension is particularly widely used, and we provide a critical examination of it drawing on research from other scientific fields. We also discuss informational metrics of complexity and their potential benefits.

	abstract = {Variation in the spatial heterogeneity of points reflects the evolutionary process or mechanism of geographical events. The key to depicting this variation is quantifying spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, the spatial heterogeneity of a point pattern is defined as the degree of aggregation-type deviation from complete spatial randomness. In such a case, a goodness-of-fit-type statistic based on the distribution of nearest-neighbor distances called the level of heterogeneity (LH*) is regarded as a standard measurement, and a normalized version called the normalized level of heterogeneity (NLH*) is proposed for datasets with different point numbers and study region areas. Considering the complex integration calculation of LH* and NLH*, simulation experiments are implemented to test the capability of some classic nearest-neighbor statistics in quantifying spatial heterogeneity. The results showed that except for the standard LH* statistic, only Clark and Evans’ statistic (A-w) and Byth and Ripley’s statistic (H-xw) are robust. Statistics NLH*, (A-w) and (H-xw) are validated by quantifying the spatial heterogeneity of two-dimensional crime events, three-dimensional earthquake events and four-dimensional origin-destination (OD) events. The results indicate that these statistics all have a reasonable explanation in quantifying spatial heterogeneity for real-world geographical events of different types and with different dimensions. Compared with NLH*, Clark and Evans’ (A-w) statistic and Byth and Ripley’s (H-xw) statistic are recommended from the perspective of accessibility.},

	abstract = {We conduct a global assessment of the spatial heterogeneity of cloud phase within the temperature range where liquid and ice can coexist. Single-shot Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization lidar retrievals are used to examine cloud phase at scales as fine as 333 m, and horizontal heterogeneity is quantified according to the frequency of switches between liquid and ice along the satellite's path. In the global mean, heterogeneity is greatest between −15 and −4°C with a peak at −5°C, when small patches of ice are prevalent within liquid-dominated clouds. Heterogeneity “hot spots” are typically found over the extratropical continents, whereas phase is relatively homogeneous over the Southern Ocean and the eastern subtropical ocean basins, where supercooled liquid clouds dominate. Even at a fixed temperature, heterogeneity undergoes a pronounced annual cycle that, in most places, consists of a minimum during autumn or winter and a maximum during spring or summer. Based on this spatial and temporal variability, it is hypothesized that heterogeneity is affected by the availability of ice nucleating particles. These results can be used to improve the representation of subgrid-scale heterogeneity in general circulation models, which has the potential to reduce longstanding model biases in cloud phase partitioning and radiative fluxes.},

	abstract = {Although theoretical and empirical studies show that spatial heterogeneity has important effects on the dynamics of populations and the structure of communities, there has been little rigorous quantification of terms like "patchiness" or "spatial heterogeneity" in studies of lotic systems. In order to compare the spatial heterogeneity of different systems and understand the causes and consequences of that heterogeneity, we must first be able to quantitatively measure it. Spatial heterogeneity has many aspects that change with the scale of our observations, so we need a battery of descriptive measures that explicitly consider the scale-dependence of ecological pattern. Response variables exhibiting similar frequency distributions (i.e., similar overall variability) can have very different spatial distributions; consequently, descriptions of spatial heterogeneity require spatial data, i.e., data related to geographic locations (maps). We review statistical techniques for quantitatively describing aspects of heterogeneity in spatial data, emphasizing the decomposition of heterogeneity into different scales of variation (trends, overall variability, and spatial dependence or autocorrelation). Gradients in spatial data can be evaluated using trend analyses (e.g., regressions), whereas the spatial structure of variation around trends can be evaluated using geostatistical methods. The central concept of geostatistics is spatial dependence, which is the degree to which values of a response variable differ as a function of the distance (lag) between sampling locations. Semivariograms plot variation among samples separated by a common lag versus lag, and can be objectively decomposed by piece-wise regression techniques to estimate the strength and scales of spatial dependence. A variety of other methods can be used to quantify spatial heterogeneity from categorical and numerical maps depending on the question of interest and the underlying structure of the spatial data (e.g., methods derived from fractal geometry and information theory, nearest neighbor analysis, spectral analysis, Mantel's test). Spatial heterogeneity in stream organisms is driven by local variation in environmental conditions, by interactions between individuals of the same or different species, and by the effects of organisms on their abiotic environment. By applying geostatistical methods to spatial data collected from field experiments, stream ecologists can evaluate the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the spatial arrangement of organisms in streams. We present examples of data obtained from experiments examining how consumers affect, and respond to, spatial heterogeneity in their resources. The results indicate that consumer-resource feedbacks should be considered when modeling the causes and consequences of spatial heterogeneity in streams.},

Current models use grid spacings of ∼ 200 km, while satellite observations of aerosol use so-called pixels of ∼ 10 km. Ground site or airborne observations relate to even smaller spatial scales. We study the errors incurred due to different resolutions by aggregating high-resolution simulations (10 km grid spacing) over either the large areas of global model grid boxes ("perfect" model data) or small areas corresponding to the pixels of satellite measurements or the field of view of ground sites ("perfect" observations). Our analysis suggests that instantaneous root-mean-square (RMS) differences of perfect observations from perfect global models can easily amount to 30–160 \%, for a range of observables like AOT (aerosol optical thickness), extinction, black carbon mass concentrations, PM2.5, number densities and CCN (cloud condensation nuclei). These differences, due entirely to different spatial sampling of models and observations, are often larger than measurement errors in real observations. Temporal averaging over a month of data reduces these differences more strongly for some observables (e.g. a threefold reduction for AOT), than for others (e.g. a twofold reduction for surface black carbon concentrations), but significant RMS differences remain (10–75 \%). Note that this study ignores the issue of temporal sampling of real observations, which is likely to affect our present monthly error estimates. We examine several other strategies (e.g. spatial aggregation of observations, interpolation of model data) for reducing these differences and show their effectiveness. Finally, we examine consequences for the use of flight campaign data in global model evaluation and show that significant biases may be introduced depending on the flight strategy used.},

	abstract = {Recent use of satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) to characterize surface concentrations of particulate matter (PM) air pollution has proven extremely valuable in estimating exposures for health effects studies. While the spatial resolutions of satellite data provide far better coverage than existing fixed site surface monitoring stations, they are not able to capture atmospheric processes such as dilution of primary pollutants that vary at small spatial scales. As a result, small-scale variability due to highly localized sources such as traffic may be poorly represented, which in turn may lead to exposure measurement error in epidemiological analyses. Using a fixed spatial grid representing 4.4 km Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aerosol observations, we examined the spatial variability in fine and coarse mode PM (PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 respectively) measured at ground monitors from a unique spatially-dense sampling campaign in Southern California. We found that while the variance in measured PM2.5 differed seasonally (warm 6.82 μg2/m6 and cool 24.5 μg2/m6) across the study region, the average subgrid ({\textless}4.4 km) variance did not (warm 2.03 μg2/m6 and cool 2.43 μg2/m6) and was significantly smaller. On the other hand, ground monitor PM2.5–10 concentrations showed large variance in warm (18.6 μg2/m6) and cool (20.6 μg2/m6) seasons, as well as seasonal differences in subgrid variance (warm 8.90 μg2/m6 and cool 3.28 μg2/m6). Geostatistical analysis of the semivariance as a function of distance indicated that variability in measured PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 concentrations was relatively constant for spatial scales of one to five kilometers, but there was evidence of small-scale ({\textasciitilde}500 m) variability in PM2.5–10 concentrations in the cool season. The lack of small-scale spatial variability in the warm season was likely due to large photochemical contributions to regional PM2.5, and greater regional contributions to PM2.5–10 from windblown dust. In contrast, in the cool season there tends to be greater localized concentrations from primary traffic sources due to stronger nocturnal inversions and delayed morning winds reducing dilution that contribute to greater spatial heterogeneity. Overall, these results suggest that regional contributions tend to dominate PM2.5, and spatial resolutions of satellite observations including the 4.4 km MISR and 3 km MODIS aerosol products aptly capture relevant spatial variability. Coarse PM2.5–10 can have seasonally dependent localized contributions, leading to small-scale variability below current satellite aerosol product resolutions.},

This value satisfies the conditions for the lacunarity cutoff function and forms the basis of a heterogeneity index. We evaluate the behavior of both parameters in monofractal, clustered, and periodic systems. In addition, we demonstrate the broad utility of our approach to the scientific community by classifying the spatial heterogeneity of fractured sea ice and comparing our findings to existing measures.

	abstract = {Multi-pollutant chemical transport models (CTMs) are being routinely used to predict the impacts of emission controls on the concentrations and deposition of primary and secondary pollutants. While these models have a fairly comprehensive treatment of the governing atmospheric processes, they are unable to correctly represent processes that occur at very fine scales, such as the near-source transport and chemistry of emissions from elevated point sources, because of their relatively coarse horizontal resolution. Several different approaches have been used to address this limitation, such as using fine grids, adaptive grids, hybrid modeling, or an embedded sub-grid scale plume model, i.e., plume-in-grid (PinG) modeling. In this paper, we first discuss the relative merits of these various approaches used to resolve sub-grid scale effects in grid models, and then focus on PinG modeling which has been very effective in addressing the problems listed above. We start with a history and review of PinG modeling from its initial applications for ozone modeling in the Urban Airshed Model (UAM) in the early 1980s using a relatively simple plume model, to more sophisticated and state-of-the-science plume models, that include a full treatment of gas-phase, aerosol, and cloud chemistry, embedded in contemporary models such as CMAQ, CAMx, and WRF-Chem. We present examples of some typical results from PinG modeling for a variety of applications, discuss the implications of PinG on model predictions of source attribution, and discuss possible future developments and applications for PinG modeling.},

The approach can be used in three-dimensional chemical transport models (CTMs) of all scales, from urban to global. The parameterization's results are evaluated against the predictions of a detailed one-dimensional aerosol dynamics model under a variety of atmospheric conditions. The parameterization agrees well with the dynamic model when the mean emitted particle size is smaller than that of the existing particles.

Compared to simulations using two other previous treatments of sub-grid sulphate, simulations using P6 sub-grid sulphate predicted similar or smaller increases (depending on other model assumptions) in globally, annually averaged concentrations of particles larger than 80 nm (N80). We test in simulations using P6 sub-grid sulphate the sensitivity of particle number concentrations to changes in SO2 or NOx emissions to represent recent emissions control changes. For global increases of 50\% in emissions of either SO2 or NOx, or both SO2 and NOx, we find that globally, annually averaged N80 increase by 9.00, 1.47, or 10.24\% respectively. However, both sub-grid and grid-resolved processes contribute to these changes. Finally, we compare the model results against observations of particle number concentrations. Compared with previous treatments of sub-grid sulphate, use of the P6 parameterization generally improves correlation with observed particle number concentrations. The P6 parameterization is able to resolve spatial heterogeneity in new-particle formation and growth that cannot be resolved by any constant assumptions about sub-grid sulphate. However, the differences in annually averaged aerosol size distributions due to the treatment of sub-grid sulphate at the measurement sites examined here are too small to unambiguously establish P6 as providing better agreement with observations.},

	abstract = {Cloud drop condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) particles determine to a large extent cloud microstructure and, consequently, cloud albedo and the dynamic response of clouds to aerosol-induced changes to precipitation. This can modify the reflected solar radiation and the thermal radiation emitted to space. Measurements of tropospheric CCN and IN over large areas have not been possible and can be only roughly approximated from satellite-sensor-based estimates of optical properties of aerosols. Our lack of ability to measure both CCN and cloud updrafts precludes disentangling the effects of meteorology from those of aerosols and represents the largest component in our uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. Ways to improve the retrieval accuracy include multiangle and multipolarimetric passive measurements of the optical signal and multispectral lidar polarimetric measurements. Indirect methods include proxies of trace gases, as retrieved by hyperspectral sensors. Perhaps the most promising emerging direction is retrieving the CCN properties by simultaneously retrieving convective cloud drop number concentrations and updraft speeds, which amounts to using clouds as natural CCN chambers. These satellite observations have to be constrained by in situ observations of aerosol-cloud-precipitation-climate (ACPC) interactions, which in turn constrain a hierarchy of model simulations of ACPC. Since the essence of a general circulation model is an accurate quantification of the energy and mass fluxes in all forms between the surface, atmosphere and outer space, a route to progress is proposed here in the form of a series of box flux closure experiments in the various climate regimes. A roadmap is provided for quantifying the ACPC interactions and thereby reducing the uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing.},

This review focuses on recent theoretical studies and important mechanisms on aerosol–cloud interactions and discusses the significances of aerosol impacts on radiative forcing and precipitation extremes associated with different cloud systems. The authors summarize the main obstacles preventing the science from making a leap—for example, the lack of concurrent profile measurements of cloud dynamics, microphysics, and aerosols over a wide region on the observation side and the large variability of cloud microphysics parameterizations resulting in a large spread of modeling results on the modeling side. Therefore, large efforts are needed to escalate understanding. Future directions should focus on obtaining concurrent measurements of aerosol properties and cloud microphysical and dynamic properties over a range of temporal and spatial scales collected over typical climate regimes and closure studies, as well as improving understanding and parameterizations of cloud microphysics such as ice nucleation, mixed-phase properties, and hydrometeor size and fall speed.},

	abstract = {Abstract An extended period numerical integration of a baroclinic primitive equation model has been made for the simulation and the study of the dynamics of the atmosphere's general circulation. The solution corresponding to external gravitational propagation is filtered by requiring the vertically integrated divergence to vanish identically. The vertical structure permits as dependent variables the horizontal wind at two internal levels and a single temperature, with the static stability entering as a parameter. The incoming radiation is a function of latitude only corresponding to the annual mean, and the outgoing radiation is taken to be a function of the local temperature. With the requirement for thermal equilibrium, the domain mean temperature is specified as a parameter. The role of condensation is taken into account only as it effectively reduces the static stability. All other external sources and sinks of heat are assumed to balance each other locally, and are thus omitted. The kinematics are that of a fluid on a sphere bounded by smooth zonal walls at the equator and at approximately 64° latitude. The dissipative sinks are provided by: (a) surface stresses proportional through a drag coefficient to the square of the surface wind which is suitably extrapolated from above, (b) internal convective stresses proportional to the vertical wind shear, and (c) lateral diffusion of momentum and heat through an exchange coefficient which depends on the local horizontal rate of strain—a horizontal length scale entering as the governing parameter. For a given specification of the parameters, an integration for 60 days has been made from initial conditions where random temperature disturbances have been superimposed on a zonally symmetric regime which is baroclinically unstable according to linear theory. This experiment not only displays the scale selective character of baroclinic instability, yielding zonal wave number 5 to 6, but also predicts an index or energy cycle. The period of this cycle is 11 to 12 days for the first 40 days of the experiment, then lengthening to 17 days while diminishing in amplitude during the latter part. The resulting mean zonal velocity profile is in good qualitative agreement with observation, but too intense, presumably because the effective static stability parameter is taken too large. Furthermore this profile is found to be no more than 5 percent super-geostrophic poleward of the angular momentum maximum and no more than 2 percent sub-geostrophic equatorward. The total zonal angular momentum remains constant to within 2 percent irrespective of the phase of the index cycle. This balance is controlled by the surface wind distribution which agrees quite well with observation. The poleward transport is mainly accomplished by the large-scale eddies, whereas the internal vertical flux is predominantly a transfer of the earth's angular momentum by the meridional circulation. The poleward heat transport is primarily accomplished by a Hadley circulation at low latitudes but by the large-scale horizontal eddies in mid-latitudes, where a Ferrel circulation tends to compensate through an equatorward flux. This compensation at mid-latitudes by an indirect meridional circulation is also quite evident, in the potential-kinetic energy transformations. Comparison of the momentum and heat transfer with observed data when available shows reasonably good quantitative agreement. The lateral transfer of momentum and heat by the non-linear diffusion, which parametrically is supposed to simulate the action of motions of sub-grid scale, accounts for a significant portion of the total eddy transfer. Although no direct comparison with the corresponding transfer in the real atmosphere is available, intuitively our small-scale diffusion appears to play too large a role. A diagnosis is made of the transformations among the baratropic and baroclinic parts of the kinetic energy as well as the zonal mean and zonal perturbation parts of the available potential and kinetic energy. This reveals the dominant paths that the energy passes through from source to ultimate sinks and the processes responsible for these transformations. It is found that the partitioning of dissipation by the energy components may differ considerably from estimates made from observation.},

The agreement of calculated statistics against those measured by Laufer ranges from good to marginal. The eddy shapes are examined, and only the u-component, longitudinal eddies are found to be elongated in the downstream direction. However, the lateral v eddies have distinct downstream tilts. The turbulence energy balance is examined, including the separate effects of vertical diffusion of pressure and local kinetic energy.It is concluded that the numerical approach to the problem of turbulence at large Reynolds numbers is already profitable, with increased accuracy to be expected with modest increase of numerical resolution.},

	abstract = {Recent increases in computing power mean that atmospheric models for numerical weather prediction are now able to operate at grid spacings of the order of a few hundred meters, comparable to the dominant turbulence length scales in the atmospheric boundary layer. As a result, models are starting to partially resolve the coherent overturning structures in the boundary layer. In this resolution regime, the so-called boundary layer “gray zone,” neither the techniques of high-resolution atmospheric modeling (a few tens of meters resolution) nor those of traditional meteorological models (a few kilometers resolution) are appropriate because fundamental assumptions behind the parameterizations are violated. Nonetheless, model simulations in this regime may remain highly useful. In this paper, a newly formed gray zone boundary layer community lays the basis for parameterizing gray zone turbulence, identifies the challenges in high-resolution atmospheric modeling and presents different gray zone boundary layer models. We discuss both the successful applications and the limitations of current parameterization approaches, and consider various issues in extending promising research approaches into use for numerical weather prediction. The ultimate goal of the research is the development of unified boundary layer parameterizations valid across all scales.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the spatial heterogeneity of three landscapes along an altitudinal gradient and different human land use. The main aim was the identification of appropriate landscape indicators using different extents. ASTER image was used to create a land cover map consisting of three landscapes which differed in altitude and land use. A number of landscape metrics quantifying patch complexity, configuration, diversity and connectivity were derived from the thematic map at the landscape level. There were significant differences among the three landscapes regarding these four aspects of landscape heterogeneity. The analysis revealed a specific pattern of land use where lowlands are being increasingly utilized by humans (percentage of agricultural land=65.84\%) characterized by physical connectedness (high values of Patch Cohesion Index) and relatively simple geometries (low values of fractal dimension index). The landscape pattern of uplands was found to be highly diverse based upon the Shannon Diversity index. After selecting the scale (600ha) where metrics values stabilized, it was shown that metrics were more correlated at the small scale of 60ha. From the original 24 metrics, 14 individual metrics with high Spearman correlation coefficient and Variance Inflation Factor criterion were eliminated, leaving 10 representative metrics for subsequent analysis. Data reduction analysis showed that Patch Density, Area-Weighted Mean Fractal Dimension Index and Patch Cohesion Index are suitable to describe landscape patterns irrespective of the scale. A systematic screening of these metrics could enhance a deeper understanding of the results obtained by them and contribute to a sustainable landscape management of Mediterranean landscapes.},

	abstract = {We present a method to describe the relationship between particle dry diameter and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity using a single hygroscopicity parameter κ. Values of the hygroscopicity parameter are between 0.5 and 1.4 for highly-CCN-active salts such as sodium chloride, between 0.01 and 0.5 for slightly to very hygroscopic organic species, and 0 for nonhygroscopic components. Observations indicate that atmospheric particulate matter is typically characterized by 0.1\&lt;\&kappa;\&lt;0.9. If compositional data are available and if the hygroscopicity parameter of each component is known, a multicomponent hygroscopicity parameter can be computed by weighting component hygroscopicity parameters by their volume fractions in the mixture. In the absence of information on chemical composition, experimental data for complex, multicomponent particles can be fitted to obtain the hygroscopicity parameter. The hygroscopicity parameter can thus also be used to conveniently model the CCN activity of atmospheric particles, including those containing insoluble components. We confirm the applicability of the hygroscopicity parameter and its mixing rule by applying it to published hygroscopic diameter growth factor and CCN-activation data for single- and multi-component particles containing varying amounts of inorganic, organic and surface active compounds. We suggest that \&kappa; may be fit to CCN data assuming \&sigma;s/a=0.072 J m\&minus;2 and present a table of \&kappa; derived for this value and T=298.15 K. The predicted hygroscopicities for mixtures that contain the surfactant fulvic acid agree within uncertainties with the measured values. It thus appears that this approach is adequate for predicting CCN activity of mixed particles containing surface active materials, but the generality of this assumption requires further verification.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric anthropogenic aerosols contribute the second-largest forcing to climate change, but with high uncertainty owing to their spatio-temporal variability and complicated optical properties. In this Review, we synthesize understanding of aerosol observations and their radiative and climate effects. Aerosols offset about one-third of the warming effect by anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Yet, in regions and seasons where the absorbing aerosol fraction is high — such as South America and East and South Asia — substantial atmospheric warming can occur. The internal mixing and the vertical distribution of aerosols, which alters both the direct effect and aerosol–cloud interactions, might further enhance this warming. Despite extensive research in aerosol–cloud interactions, there is still at least a 50\% spread in total aerosol forcing estimates. This ongoing uncertainty is linked, in part, to the poor measurement of anthropogenic and natural aerosol absorption, as well as the little-understood effects of aerosols on clouds. Next-generation, space-borne, multi-angle polarization and active remote sensing, combined with in situ observations, offer opportunities to better constrain aerosol scattering, absorption and size distribution, thus, improving models to refine estimates of aerosol forcing and climate effects.},

	abstract = {Although long considered to be of marginal importance to global climate change, tropospheric aerosol contributes substantially to radiative forcing, and anthropogenic sulfate aerosol in particular has imposed a major perturbation to this forcing. Both the direct scattering of short-wavelength solar radiation and the modification of the shortwave reflective properties of clouds by sulfate aerosol particles increase planetary albedo, thereby exerting a cooling influence on the planet. Current climate forcing due to anthropogenic sulfate is estimated to be -1 to -2 watts per square meter, globally averaged. This perturbation is comparable in magnitude to current anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing but opposite in sign. Thus, the aerosol forcing has likely offset global greenhouse warming to a substantial degree. However, differences in geographical and seasonal distributions of these forcings preclude any simple compensation. Aerosol effects must be taken into account in evaluating anthropogenic influences on past, current, and projected future climate and in formulating policy regarding controls on emission of greenhouse gases and sulfur dioxide. Resolution of such policy issues requires integrated research on the magnitude and geographical distribution of aerosol climate forcing and on the controlling chemical and physical processes.},

	abstract = {Motor vehicle emissions usually constitute the most significant source of ultrafine particles (diameter {\textless}0.1μm) in an urban environment. Zhu et al. (J. Air Waste Manage. Assoc., 2002, accepted for publication) conducted systematic measurements of the concentration and size distribution of ultrafine particles in the vicinity of a highway dominated by gasoline vehicle. The present study compares these previous measurements with those made on Interstate 710 freeway in Los Angeles. The 710 freeway was selected because more than 25\% of the vehicles are heavy-duty diesel trucks. Particle number concentration and size distribution in the size range from 6 to 220nm were measured by a condensation particle counter and a scanning mobility particle sizer, respectively. Measurements were taken at 17, 20, 30, 90, 150, and 300m downwind and 200m upwind from the center of the freeway. At each sampling location, concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and black carbon (BC) were also measured by a Dasibi CO monitor and an Aethalometer, respectively. The range of average concentration of CO, BC and total particle number concentration at 17m was 1.9–2.6ppm, 20.3–24.8μg/m3, 1.8×105–3.5×105/cm3, respectively. Relative concentration of CO, BC and particle number decreased exponentially and tracked each other well as one moves away from the freeway. Both atmospheric dispersion and coagulation appears to contribute to the rapid decrease in particle number concentration and change in particle size distribution with increasing distance from the freeway. Average traffic flow during the sampling periods was 12,180 vehicles/h with more than 25\% of vehicles being heavy-duty diesel trucks. Ultrafine particle number concentration measured at 300m downwind from the freeway was indistinguishable from upwind background concentration. These data may be used to estimate exposure to ultrafine particles in the vicinity of major highways.},

	abstract = {Aircraft observations of meteorological, trace gas, and aerosol properties were made between May and September 2013 in the southeastern United States (US). Regionally representative aggregate vertical profiles of median and interdecile ranges of the measured parameters were constructed from 37 individual aircraft profiles made in the afternoon when a well-mixed boundary layer with typical fair-weather cumulus was present (Wagner et al., 2015). We use these 0–4 km aggregate profiles and a simple model to calculate the sensitivity of aerosol optical depth (AOD) to changes in dry aerosol mass, relative humidity, mixed-layer height, the central diameter and width of the particle size distribution, hygroscopicity, and dry and wet refractive index, while holding the other parameters constant. The calculated sensitivity is a result of both the intrinsic sensitivity and the observed range of variation in these parameters. These observationally based sensitivity studies indicate that the relationship between AOD and dry aerosol mass in these conditions in the southeastern US can be highly variable and is especially sensitive to relative humidity (RH). For example, calculated AOD ranged from 0.137 to 0.305 as the RH was varied between the 10th and 90th percentile profiles with dry aerosol mass held constant. Calculated AOD was somewhat less sensitive to aerosol hygroscopicity, mean size, and geometric standard deviation, σg. However, some chemistry–climate models prescribe values of σg substantially larger than we or others observe, leading to potential high biases in model-calculated AOD of ∼ 25 \%. Finally, AOD was least sensitive to observed variations in dry and wet aerosol refractive index and to changes in the height of the well-mixed surface layer. We expect these findings to be applicable to other moderately polluted and background continental air masses in which an accumulation mode between 0.1–0.5 µm diameter dominates aerosol extinction.},

	abstract = {In the most advanced aerosol-climate models it is common to represent the aerosol particle size distribution in terms of several log-normal modes. This approach, motivated by computational efficiency, makes assumptions about the shape of the particle distribution that may not always capture the properties of global aerosol. Here, a global modal aerosol microphysics module (GLOMAP-mode) is evaluated and improved by comparing against a sectional version (GLOMAP-bin) and observations in the same 3-D global offline chemistry transport model. With both schemes, the model captures the main features of the global particle size distribution, with sub-micron aerosol approximately unimodal in continental regions and bi-modal in marine regions. Initial bin-mode comparisons showed that the current values for two size distribution parameter settings in the modal scheme (mode widths and inter-modal separation sizes) resulted in clear biases compared to the sectional scheme. By adjusting these parameters in the modal scheme, much better agreement is achieved against the bin scheme and observations. Annual mean surface-level mass of sulphate, sea-salt, black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) are within 25\% in the two schemes in nearly all regions. Surface level concentrations of condensation nuclei (CN), cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), surface area density and condensation sink also compare within 25\% in most regions. However, marine CCN concentrations between 30\&deg; N and 30\&deg; S are systematically 25–60\% higher in the modal model, which we attribute to differences in size-resolved particle growth or cloud-processing. Larger differences also exist in regions or seasons dominated by biomass burning and in free-troposphere and high-latitude regions. Indeed, in the free-troposphere, GLOMAP-mode BC is a factor 2–4 higher than GLOMAP-bin, likely due to differences in size-resolved scavenging. Nevertheless, in most parts of the atmosphere, we conclude that bin-mode differences are much less than model-observation differences, although some processes are missing in these runs which may pose a bigger challenge to modal schemes (e.g., boundary layer nucleation and ultra-fine sea-spray). The findings here underline the need for a spectrum of complexity in global models, with size-resolved aerosol properties predicted by modal schemes needing to be continually benchmarked and improved against freely evolving sectional schemes and observations.},

	abstract = {Light absorption by black carbon (BC) particles emitted from fossil fuel combustion depends on their size and how thickly they are coated with nonrefractory species such as ammonium, sulfate, nitrate, organics, and water. The cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation behavior of a particle depends on its dry size and the hygroscopicities of all the individual species mixed together. It is therefore necessary to represent both size and mixing state of aerosols to reliably predict their climate-relevant properties in atmospheric models. Here we describe and evaluate a novel sectional framework in the Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (box model), referred to as MOSAIC-mix, that represents the mixing state by resolving aerosol dry size (Ddry), BC dry mass fraction (wBC), and hygroscopicity (k). Using 10 idealized urban plume scenarios in which different types of aerosols evolve over 24 h under a range of atmospherically relevant conditions, we examine errors in CCN concentrations and optical properties with respect to the level of detail of the aerosol mixing state representation. We find that a small number of wBC and k bins can achieve significant reductions in the errors and propose a configuration with 24 Ddry bins, 2 wBC bins, and 2 k bins that give average errors of about 5\% or less in CCN concentrations and optical properties, 3–4 times lower than those from size-only resolved (i.e., internally mixed) simulations. These results suggest that MOSAIC-mix is suitable for use in regional and global models to examine the effects of mixing state on aerosol-radiation-cloud feedbacks.},

The model explicitly resolved the size and composition of individual particles from a number of sources and tracked their evolution due to condensation, evaporation, coagulation, emission, and dilution. The ensemble black carbon (BC)–specific absorption cross section increased by 40\% over the course of 2 days due to BC aging by condensation and coagulation. Threefold and fourfold enhancements in CCN/CN ratios were predicted to occur within 6 h for 0.2\% and 0.5\% supersaturations (S), respectively. The particle-resolved results were used to evaluate the errors in the optical and CCN activation properties that would be predicted by a conventional sectional framework that assumes monodisperse, internally mixed particles within each bin. This assumption artificially increased the ensemble BC-specific absorption by 14–30\% and decreased the single scattering albedo (SSA) by 0.03–0.07, while the bin resolution had a negligible effect. In contrast, the errors in CCN/CN ratios were sensitive to the bin resolution for a chosen supersaturation. For S = 0.2\%, the CCN/CN ratio predicted using 100 internally mixed bins was up to 25\% higher than the particle-resolved results, while it was up to 125\% higher using 10 internally mixed bins. Neglecting coagulation overpredicted aerosol water content and number concentrations ({\textless}0.2 μm), causing errors in SSA from −0.02 to 0.035 and overprediction of CCN concentrations by 25–80\% at S = 0.5\%.},

	abstract = {Aerosol effects on clouds and radiation are a large source of uncertainty in our understanding of human impacts on the climate system. Uncertainty in aerosol effects results from uncertainty in parameter values, known as parametric uncertainty, and from uncertainty from the model’s structure, known as structural uncertainty. While previous studies have assessed the impact of parametric uncertainty on modeled forcing, structural errors from the numerical representation of particle distributions and their dynamics have not been well quantified. Here we present a framework for quantifying error in aerosol size distributions and cloud condensation nuclei activity, which we apply to the widely used 4-mode version of the Modal Aerosol Module (MAM4). Box model predictions from the MAM4 are evaluated against the Particle Monte Carlo Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (PartMC-MOSAIC), a benchmark model that tracks the evolution of individual particles. We show that size distributions simulated by MAM4 diverge from those simulated by PartMC-MOSAIC after only a few hours of aging by condensation and coagulation in polluted conditions, which leads to large errors in modeled cloud condensation nuclei concentrations. We find that differences between MAM4 and PartMC-MOSAIC are largest under polluted conditions, where the size distribution evolves rapidly though aging. These findings indicate that structural error in modeled aerosol properties is a key factor contributing to uncertainty in aerosol forcing.},

	abstract = {Ozone production in global chemical models is dependent on model resolution because ozone chemistry is inherently nonlinear, the timescales for chemical production are short, and precursors are artificially distributed over the spatial scale of the model grid. In this study we examine the sensitivity of ozone, its precursors, and its production to resolution by running a global chemical transport model at four different resolutions between T21 (5.6° × 5.6°) and T106 (1.1° × 1.1°) and by quantifying the errors in regional and global budgets. The sensitivity to vertical mixing through the parameterization of boundary layer turbulence is also examined. We find less ozone production in the boundary layer at higher resolution, consistent with slower chemical production in polluted emission regions and greater export of precursors. Agreement with ozonesonde and aircraft measurements made during the NASA TRACE-P campaign over the western Pacific in spring 2001 is consistently better at higher resolution. We demonstrate that the numerical errors in transport processes on a given resolution converge geometrically for a tracer at successively higher resolutions. The convergence in ozone production on progressing from T21 to T42, T63, and T106 resolution is likewise monotonic but indicates that there are still large errors at 120 km scales, suggesting that T106 resolution is too coarse to resolve regional ozone production. Diagnosing the ozone production and precursor transport that follow a short pulse of emissions over east Asia in springtime allows us to quantify the impacts of resolution on both regional and global ozone. Production close to continental emission regions is overestimated by 27\% at T21 resolution, by 13\% at T42 resolution, and by 5\% at T106 resolution. However, subsequent ozone production in the free troposphere is not greatly affected. We find that the export of short-lived precursors such as NOx by convection is overestimated at coarse resolution.},

            This work documents version two of the Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). E3SMv2 is a significant evolution from its predecessor E3SMv1, resulting in a model that is nearly twice as fast and with a simulated climate that is improved in many metrics. We describe the physical climate model in its lower horizontal resolution configuration consisting of 110 km atmosphere, 165 km land, 0.5° river routing model, and an ocean and sea ice with mesh spacing varying between 60 km in the mid‐latitudes and 30 km at the equator and poles. The model performance is evaluated with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Characterization of Klima simulations augmented with historical simulations as well as simulations to evaluate impacts of different forcing agents. The simulated climate has many realistic features of the climate system, with notable improvements in clouds and precipitation compared to E3SMv1. E3SMv1 suffered from an excessively high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of 5.3 K. In E3SMv2, ECS is reduced to 4.0 K which is now within the plausible range based on a recent World Climate Research Program assessment. However, a number of important biases remain including a weak Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, deficiencies in the characteristics and spectral distribution of tropical atmospheric variability, and a significant underestimation of the observed warming in the second half of the historical period. An analysis of single‐forcing simulations indicates that correcting the historical temperature bias would require a substantial reduction in the magnitude of the aerosol‐related forcing.

            Plain Language Summary
            The U.S. Department of Energy recently released version two of its Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). E3SMv2 experienced a significant evolution in many of its model components (most notably the atmosphere and sea ice models), and its supporting software infrastructure. In this work, we document the computational performance of E3SMv2 and analyze its ability to reproduce the observed climate. To accomplish this, we utilize the standard Diagnosis and Evaluation and Characterization of Klima experiments augmented with historical simulations for the period 1850–2015. We find that E3SMv2 is nearly twice as fast as its predecessor and more accurately reproduces the observed climate in a number of metrics, most notably clouds and precipitation. We also find that the model's simulated response to increasing carbon dioxide (the equilibrium climate sensitivity) is much more realistic. Unfortunately, E3SMv2 underestimates the global mean surface temperature compared to observations during the second half of historical period. Using sensitivity experiments, where forcing agents (carbon dioxide, aerosols) are selectively disabled in the model, we determine that correcting this problem would require a strong reduction in the impact of aerosols.

	abstract = {We implemented the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA) in both the high- and low-top model versions of the Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2). CARMA is a sectional microphysical model, which we use for aerosol in both the troposphere and stratosphere. CARMA is fully coupled to chemistry, clouds, radiation, and transport routines in CESM2. This development enables the comparison of simulations with a sectional (CARMA) and a modal (MAM4) aerosol microphysical model in the same modeling framework. The new implementation of CARMA has been adopted from previous work, with some additions that align with the current CESM2 Modal Aerosol Model (MAM4) implementation. The main updates include an interactive secondary organic aerosol description in CARMA, using the volatility basis set (VBS) approach, updated wet removal, and the use of transient emissions of aerosols and trace gases. In addition, we implemented an alternative aerosol nucleation scheme in CARMA, which is also used in MAM4. Detailed comparisons of stratospheric aerosol properties after the Mount Pinatubo eruption reveal the importance of prescribing sulfur injections in a larger region rather than in a single column to better represent the observed evolution of aerosols. Both CARMA and MAM4 in CESM2 are able to represent stratospheric and tropospheric aerosol properties reasonably well when compared to observations. Several differences in the performance of the two aerosol models show, in general, an improved representation of aerosols when using the sectional aerosol model in CESM2. These include a better representation of the aerosol size distribution after the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption in CARMA compared to MAM4. MAM4 produces on average smaller aerosols and less removal than CARMA, which results in a larger total mass. Both CARMA and MAM4 reproduce the stratospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) within the error bar of the observations between 2001 and 2020, except for recent larger volcanic eruptions that are overestimated by both model configurations. The CARMA background surface area density and aerosol size distribution in the stratosphere and troposphere compare well to observations, with some underestimation of the Aitken-mode size range. MAM4 shows shortcomings in reproducing coarse-mode aerosol distributions in the stratosphere and troposphere. This work outlines additional development needs for CESM2 CARMA to improve the model compared to observations in both the troposphere and stratosphere.},

	abstract = {Ultrafine particles (PM0.1), which are present in the air in large numbers, pose a health risk. They generally enter the body through the lungs but translocate to essentially all organs. Compared to fine particles (PM2.5), they cause more pulmonary inflammation and are retained longer in the lung. Their toxicity is increased with smaller size, larger surface area, adsorbed surface material, and the physical characteristics of the particles. Exposure to PM0.1 induces cough and worsens asthma. Metal fume fever is a systemic disease of lung inflammation most likely caused by PM0.1. The disease is manifested by systemic symptoms hours after exposure to metal fumes, usually through welding. PM0.1 cause systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulation changes that predispose individuals to ischemic cardiovascular disease and hypertension. PM0.1 are also linked to diabetes and cancer. PM0.1 can travel up the olfactory nerves to the brain and cause cerebral and autonomic dysfunction. Moreover, in utero exposure increases the risk of low birthweight. Although exposure is commonly attributed to traffic exhaust, monitored students in Ghana showed the highest exposures in a home near a trash burning site, in a bedroom with burning coils employed to abate mosquitos, in a home of an adult smoker, and in home kitchens during domestic cooking. The high point-source production and rapid redistribution make incidental exposure common, confound general population studies and are compounded by the lack of global standards and national reporting. The potential for PM0.1 to cause harm to health is great, but their precise role in many illnesses is still unknown and calls for more research.},

Thermally induced circulations, similar to the sea/lake breeze [termed nonclassical mesoscale circulations (NCMCs)], are anticipated in these situations. Growing research interest in NCMCs has developed in the recent decade. In this article, general quantifications of NCMC characteristics are sun/eyed based on modeling and observational studies, along with further elaborations on specific NCMCs. The numerical modeling studies have indicated NCMCs with intensity comparable to the sea breeze in the ideal situations of sharp contrast between extended wet soil or crop and adjacent dry land areas. Similar results were obtained when contrasts of cloud with clear sky and snow with snow-free areas were considered. For less ideal contrasts, as well as for thermal contrasts generated by some other types of forcing, weaker NCMCs were simulated. The limited observational studies have suggested that, for some potential NCMC situations, noticeable horizontal thermal gradients are produced within the lower atmosphere. In general, however, pronounced NCMC flows have not been indicated with great certainty. In many of the potential NCMC situations, the small sizes of the areas in which sensible heat flux is modified compared with the surrounding areas suggest reduced intensity of circulations in the real world, particularly in the presence of an opposing background flow. Additionally, nonuniformity of the surface sensible heat fluxes in one or both of the contrasting surfaces is likely to be an important factor in reducing the real-world intensity of NCMCs. It is concluded that emphasis on observations is essential for further progress in quantification of real-world NCMCs.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional models of atmospheric inorganic aerosols need accurate and computationally efficient parameterizations of activity coefficients of various electrolytes in multicomponent aqueous solutions. In this paper, we extend the Taylor's series expansion mixing rule used by C. Wagner in 1952 for estimating activity coefficients in dilute alloy solutions to aqueous electrolyte solutions at any concentration. The resulting method, called the multicomponent Taylor expansion method (MTEM), estimates the mean activity coefficient of an electrolyte in a multicomponent solution on the basis of its values in binary solutions of all the electrolytes present in the mixture at the solution water activity aw, assuming aw is equal to the ambient relative humidity. MTEM is applied here for atmospheric aerosol systems containing H+, NH4+, Na+, Ca2+, SO42−, HSO4−, NO3−, and Cl− ions. The aerosol water content is calculated using the Zdanovskii-Stokes-Robinson (ZSR) method. For self-consistency, most of the MTEM and ZSR parameters are derived using the comprehensive Pitzer-Simonson-Clegg model at 298.15 K and are valid for an aw range of 0.2–0.97. Because CaSO4 is sparingly soluble, it is treated as a solid in the model over the entire aw range. MTEM is evaluated for several multicomponent systems representing various continental and marine aerosols and is contrasted against the mixing rule of C. L. Kusik and H. P. Meissner and of L. A. Bromley and the newer approach of S. Metzger and colleagues. Predictions of MTEM are found to be generally within a factor of 0.8–1.25 of the comprehensive Pitzer-Simonson-Clegg model and are shown to be significantly more accurate than predictions of the other three methods. MTEM also yields a noniterative solution of the bisulfate ion dissociation in sulfate-rich systems: a major computational advantage over other ionic-strength-based methods that require an iterative solution. CPU time requirements of MTEM relative to other methods for sulfate-poor and sulfate-rich systems are also discussed.},

Recent research on the atmospheric oxidation capacity in isoprene-dominated environments has suggested missing radical sources leading to significant overestimation of the lifetime of isoprene. Here we report, for the first time, a comprehensive experimental budget of isoprene in the planetary boundary layer based on airborne flux measurements along with in situ OH observations in the Southeast and Central U.S. Our findings show that surface heterogeneity of isoprene emissions lead to a physical separation of isoprene and OH resulting in an effective slowdown in the chemistry. Depending on surface heterogeneity, the intensity of segregation (Is) could locally slow down isoprene chemistry up to 30\%. The effect of segregated reactants in the planetary boundary layer on average has an influence on modeled OH radicals that is comparable to that of recently proposed radical recycling mechanisms.},

Still, the complexity of these interactions cannot be resolved by the commonly used air quality models.

The first model evaluation study on the vertical variation of aerosol number concentration and size distribution in a simple street canyon without vegetation in Cambridge, UK, shows good agreement with measurements, with simulated values mainly within a factor of 2 of observations. Dispersion conditions and local emissions govern the pedestrian-level aerosol number concentrations. Out of different aerosol processes, dry deposition is shown to decrease the total number concentration by over 20\&thinsp;\%, while condensation and dissolutional increase the total mass by over 10\&thinsp;\%.

	abstract = {The sectional aerosol module SALSA is introduced. The model has been designed to be implemented in large scale climate models, which require both accuracy and computational efficiency. We have used multiple methods to reduce the computational burden of different aerosol processes to optimize the model performance without losing physical features relevant to problematics of climate importance. The optimizations include limiting the chemical compounds and physical processes available in different size sections of aerosol particles; division of the size distribution into size sections using size sections of variable width depending on the sensitivity of microphysical processing to the particles sizes; the total amount of size sections to describe the size distribution is kept to the minimum; furthermore, only the relevant microphysical processes affecting each size section are calculated. The ability of the module to describe different microphysical processes was evaluated against explicit microphysical models and several microphysical models used in air quality models. The results from the current module show good consistency when compared to more explicit models. Also, the module was used to simulate a new particle formation event typical in highly polluted conditions with comparable results to more explicit model setup.},

	abstract = {An aerosol model (M7) designed to be coupled to general circulation models (GCM) and chemistry transport models (CTM) is described. In M7 the aerosol population is divided into two types of particles: mixed, or water-soluble particles, and insoluble particles. The particles are represented by seven classes, using a “pseudomodal” approach. Four classes are for the mixed particles representing nucleation, Aitken, accumulation, and coarse mode, and three are for the insoluble (Aitken, accumulation, and coarse mode). The components considered are mineral dust, black carbon (BC) and primary organic carbon (OC), sulfate, and sea salt. The aerosol dynamic processes in M7 include nucleation, coagulation, and condensation of sulfuric acid. Mixed particles are formed from insoluble particles by coagulation and condensation. The integration scheme is computationally very efficient. The model has been tested against the analytical solution and a sectional model for the formation of SO4/BC mixed particles, evaluating the mixing by condensation and coagulation. Furthermore, M7 has been run in free tropospheric conditions and compared to aircraft observations. M7 has proven to be accurate and fast enough to be included in a GCM or CTM.},

In this work we investigate this assumption by using the mixing state index (χ) proposed by Riemer and West (2013) to quantify the degree of external and internal mixing of aerosol populations. We combine this metric with particle-resolved model simulations to quantify error in CCN predictions when mixing state information is neglected, exploring a range of scenarios that cover different conditions of aerosol aging. We show that mixing state information does indeed become unimportant for more internally mixed populations, more precisely for populations with χ larger than 75 \%. For more externally mixed populations (χ below 20 \%) the relationship of χ and the error in CCN predictions is not unique and ranges from lower than −40 \% to about 150 \%, depending on the underlying aerosol population and the environmental supersaturation. We explain the reasons for this behavior with detailed process analyses.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric aerosol size and abundance influence radiative effects and climate change. To date, efforts to constrain global climate models' radiative forcing with in situ aerosol observations have been hamstrung by uncertainty. One source of error, the regional “representation error,” arises when accurate but sparse single-point measurements of atmospheric aerosol distributions are compared with a model value, assuming that the single-point measurement is representative of the model domain. The Portable Optical Particle Spectrometer network in the Southern Great Plains (POPSnet-SGP) campaign has demonstrated that a network of nearly autonomous aerosol instruments operating at ambient temperature and relative humidity (with low measurement error) may be used to quantify measurement representation error and investigate the factors introducing heterogeneity in aerosol distributions across a rural, continental background region. Measurements were made using Portable Optical Particle Spectrometer (POPS) instruments at several sites for five months across the Department of Energy's Aerosol Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains (ARM-SGP) User Facility in the central USA. Measurement representation error decreased with longer averaging periods (20\%–40\% between 1 s and 1 day), varied between sites by 10\%–20\% for aerosol concentration 140–2,500 nm in diameter (N\_140), and was higher for aerosols {\textgreater}400 nm in diameter (N\_400). Our measurements also show the influence of local meteorology on aerosol surface area (A\_140) and size distributions: A\_140 is positively correlated with wind speed and relative humidity, negatively correlated with precipitation, and lower given westerly winds. We conclude that the POPSnet approach provides considerably more insight into the spatial variability in the aerosol population that can be used to constrain climate models than would be available from similar networks of PM 2.5 monitors.},

The higher-resolution model produces results that agree better with observations, showing an increase of susceptibility of cloud droplet size, indicating a stronger first aerosol indirect forcing (AIF), and a decrease of susceptibility of precipitation probability, suggesting a weaker second AIF. The resolution sensitivities of AIF are attributed to those of droplet nucleation and precipitation parameterizations. The annual average AIF in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes (where most anthropogenic emissions occur) in the 0.25° model is reduced by about 1 W m−2 (−30\%) compared to the 2° model, leading to a 0.26 W m−2 reduction (−15\%) in the global annual average AIF.},

	abstract = {The cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity of an aerosol population depends on individual particles' size and composition. However, these properties are modified shortly after emission by condensation of semivolatile substances and coagulation with other particles. It is, therefore, unclear to what extent particle characteristics at emission affect CCN activity after aging by condensation and coagulation. We present a process-level analysis of particles emitted from a particular source, diesel engines, in which we isolate the separate effects of condensation and coagulation on the CCN activation of primary aerosol. We simulated aerosol dynamics in a polluted area with the Particle Monte Carlo model coupled to the Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry and evaluated three factors influencing particle CCN activity shortly after emission: (1) particle characteristics at the time of emission, (2) aging conditions near the emission source, and (3) the water vapor supersaturation at which CCN activity is evaluated. CCN concentrations were sensitive to particle properties at emission only under specific environmental conditions. Diesel emissions did not strongly influence local CCN concentrations at low cloud supersaturation thresholds (s{\textless}0.2\%), regardless of particle characteristics at emission or aging conditions. At higher supersaturation thresholds (s{\textgreater}0.2\%) and under conditions of rapid secondary aerosol formation, changes in CCN concentrations showed a greater sensitivity to particles' emission size than composition.},

Although this change in particle properties is widely recognized, the timescale for transformation is not well constrained. In this work, we simulated aerosol aging with the particle-resolved model PartMC-MOSAIC (Particle Monte Carlo – Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry) and extracted aging timescales based on changes in particle cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). We simulated nearly 300 scenarios and, through a regression analysis, identified the key parameters driving the value of the aging timescale. We show that BC's aging timescale spans from hours to weeks, depending on the local environmental conditions and the characteristics of the fresh BC-containing particles. Although the simulations presented in this study included many processes and particle interactions, we show that 80\% of the variance in the aging timescale is explained by only a few key parameters. The condensation aging timescale decreased with the flux of condensing aerosol and was shortest for the largest fresh particles, while the coagulation aging timescale decreased with the total number concentration of large (D {\textgreater}100 nm), CCN-active particles and was shortest for the smallest fresh particles. Therefore, both condensation and coagulation play important roles in aging, and their relative impact depends on the particle size range.},
